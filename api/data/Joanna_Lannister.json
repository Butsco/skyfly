She is deceased when the events of the series begin and is not expected to appear in the series. Lady Joanna was the wife of [[Tywin Lannister]] and the mother of [[Jaime Lannister]], [[Cersei Lannister]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Lannister lesser branch family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]\u00c2\u00a0''novels, Joanna Lannister was a daughter of [[Tytos Lannister]]'s younger brother, Jason Lannister, making her a first cousin of Tywin Lannister. \u00c2\u00a0Her surname was already &quot;Lannister&quot; before she married Tywin. She was the sister of\u00c2\u00a0Ser [[Stafford Lannister]].\n\nThough Tywin was always a stern and ruthless man, Joanna was said to bring out what little warmth he had, and he was even known to smile in her presence. Tywin and Joanna were very deeply in love, and thus Tywin took her death very hard. He became even more stern and was never known to smile again. Her death also fueled his unreasoning hatred for his younger son Tyrion, whom he blamed for killing her, combined with the shame he brought on their House for being born a dwarf.\n\nTywin later wanted to force all of his children into marriage-alliances to benefit House Lannister (as Cersei was later married off to King Robert), and he was offended that Tyrion risked such a future marriage alliance for himself by marrying a commoner for love when he was young ([[Tysha]]). The hypocrisy in this is that Tywin ''himself'' married for love when he wed his own first cousin Joanna, instead of entering into a marriage-alliance with another  powerful noble family. As a minor Lannister cousin, Joanna brought no new alliances, lands, or wealth with her when she married Tywin.\n\nAccording to [[Barristan Selmy]], [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] lusted after Joanna. At the wedding of Tywin and Joanna, Aerys drunkenly japed about how it was a pity the First Night tradition was banned and took too many liberties during Joanna's [[bedding]]. Tywin was not amused, and that caused further friction between him and Aerys.\n\nAccording to the books, Cersei and Jaime were eight or nine years old when their mother died, while in the TV series Cersei said she was four years old.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nJoanna was the wife of [[Tywin Lannister]], the head of [[House Lannister]] and the [[Lord of Casterly Rock]]. Joanna bore him the twins [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. She died giving birth to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/#!/guide/houses/lannister/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 guide to houses, House Lannister entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;House Lannister viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/lannister/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Lannister entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna died when Cersei and Jaime were only four years old.
