I went to college and studied fashion design. While I was there, I actually became drawn to the theater design course and what the students were doing. ... When I left college, I went into textile conservation and developed my embroidery skills there, practicing on the many textiles that came through the door. So I got much quicker at different techniques. Then, through some friends who used to make amateur short films, I got involved in the world of filmmaking, and so went from there, really.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/04/04/36776/game-of-thrones-the-woman-behind-the-costumes-intr/ Michele Carragher interview with Take Two]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn how she became the ''Game of Thrones'' embroiderer:\n\n:&quot;I got involved with the show when I was asked by the costume designer, Michelle Clapton, who I've worked with before several times. Obviously, I was drawn to the show because of the creativeness of the project. Michelle, as a designer, she has great talent and spirit, and she's a real supporter of artists and craftspeople, and she really pursues the costumes being made with traditional processes when possible. Having fabrics woven and hand-printed, and she has a lot of hand finishing done on the seams and hems. Luckily for me she likes some hand embroidery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/04/04/36776/game-of-thrones-the-woman-behind-the-costumes-intr/ Michele Carragher interview with Take Two]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 139950}}\n*[http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/04/04/36776/game-of-thrones-the-woman-behind-the-costumes-intr/ Michele Carragher interview with Take Two]\n*Michele Carragher's Website www.michelecarragherembroidery.com \n\n"}, "title": "Michele Carragher"}
