It is set in motion by the liberation of [[Tyrion Lannister]]\u00c2\u00a0by his brother, [[Jaime Lannister]], which ultimately leads to the assassination of their father, [[Tywin\u00c2\u00a0Lannister|Tywin&amp;nbsp;Lannister]], [[Hand of the King]] and [[Protector of the Realm]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the\u00c2\u00a0''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''\u00c2\u00a0novels, the assassination of Tywin is described in Chapter 77 of the third volume ''&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;''\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;. The basic details are the same in the TV series, though the motivations are drastically different:\n*Jaime sneaks into Varys's room and threatens him with a knife, forcing him to help release Tyrion. This is revealed in a flashback in the fourth volume\u00c2\u00a0''&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;''.\n*After Jaime rescues\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion from the cell, the two brothers have a talk about [[Tysha]], Tyrion's first wife, whose story was revealed in the episode\u00c2\u00a0&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;\u00c2\u00a0in the TV series.\u00c2\u00a0Jaime confesses that Tysha was no whore, instead of what Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0was told previously, and that Tywin instructed him to tell this lie\u00c2\u00a0to give Tyrion a lesson.\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion realizes that Tysha had been genuinely in love with him, and becomes furious with Jaime. He swears that Jaime, Cersei and their father will pay dearly. He also tells Jaime that Cersei that has been sleeping with other men, among them [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], Osmund Kettleblack (a knight in Cersei's service and a member of the [[Kingsguard]]), and, sarcastically, Moon Boy the court jester. Tyrion falsely admits to killing Joffrey to spite Jaime, after telling Jaime that his late son was more of a monster than the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]].\n*Tyrion is led by Varys through secret passages before killing Tywin; when Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0wants to confront Tywin, Varys\u00c2\u00a0begs him not to do something so foolish and dangerous when he is so close to freedom, but indicates him\u00c2\u00a0the secret passage to the Tower of the Hand.\n*There are two guards, Red Lester and Lum, who guard the apartments of the Hand of the King when Tyrion sneaks into them. Luckily for Tyrion, the guards do not notice him because they are too busy making jokes about Shae and arguing whether Tyrion will face his executioner bravely or beg for mercy.\n*Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0emerges from the secret passage at the hearth in the bedroom of the Tower of the Hand.\u00c2\u00a0\n*Shae tries to save herself by claiming that she did not mean what she said in the trial, and that Tywin and Cersei forced her to. In a flashback at ''&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;'' it is revealed to be a lie: Cersei offered Shae a bribe for her false testimony.\n*Shae never attempts to attack Tyrion; he kills her when she calls him &quot;my giant of Lannister&quot;. The manner of the killing is the same, though the chain that Tyrion uses to strangle her is a necklace composed of golden hand-shaped segments, which serves as the badge of office worn by the Hand of the King that Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0and Tywin successively used in\u00c2\u00a0the books, and it is the only thing Shae is wearing at the moment. In the TV series the badge for the Hand is changed to a hand-shaped brooch, thus the chain used here is accordingly changed to the one that Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0previously gave Shae in the Season 3 episode &quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;.\n*Tywin figures that it was Varys, not Jaime, who released Tyrion, and says &quot;I'll have his head for this&quot;.\n*Tywin tries to save himself by saying &quot;You are not to be killed, if that is what you fear. It's still my intent to send you to the Wall, but I could not do it without [[Mace Tyrell|Lord Tyrell]]'s consent. Put down the crossbow and we will go back to my chambers and talk of it&quot;. Tyrion either does not believe or does not care if it is true, being mistreated by his father so long and especially recently. It is doubtful whether Tywin really needed the approval of Mace Tyrell, who had nothing to do with the offer that was given to Tyrion during the trial.\n*Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0confronts\u00c2\u00a0Tywin about Tysha. After he finds his father in the privy he\u00c2\u00a0inquiries about her and her whereabouts. Tywin\u00c2\u00a0doesn't remember her name (or pretends that he doesn't, as an insult) until Tyrion refers to her as his first wife, and recalls her as Tyrion's &quot;first whore&quot;. Tyrion promptly warns his father, &quot;The next time you say that word, I'll kill you&quot; (he gives the same warning in the TV series, but referring to Shae instead). Tywin\u00c2\u00a0cannot recall, other than that he did not have her killed,\u00c2\u00a0simply stating that she was paid and the steward sent her on her way\u00c2\u00a0''&quot;wherever whores go&quot;''. Hearing this, Tyrion looses his crossbow at him.\n*Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0kills\u00c2\u00a0Tywin\u00c2\u00a0with a single\u00c2\u00a0bolt to the pelvis, which causes his bowels to loosen. Tywin says incredulously &quot;you shot me&quot;, and Tyrion says sarcastically &quot;You always were quick to grasp a situation, my lord. That must be why you're the [[Hand of the King]]&quot;.\u00c2\u00a0Tywin angrily rages Tyrion is no son of his, to which Tyrion retorts that Tywin is wrong; they are more alike than\u00c2\u00a0Tywin ever wanted to admit. Tyrion departs after telling his father to do him a courtesy and die quickly, noting from the smell as Tywin's corpse voids its bowels as he leaves that for once\u00c2\u00a0his father did as he asked.\u00c2\u00a0The narration remarks that the often repeated jape about Tywin was another lie as he, in the end, &quot;did not shit gold.&quot;\n*The account of the assassination concludes with Tywin's death. The escape of Tyrion and Varys is not depicted.\u00c2\u00a0It is not revealed until ''A Dance with Dragons'' that Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0successfully escaped from King's Landing, while Varys disappears from the book after he indicates\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0the secret passage, and for a quite long period his whereabouts are unknown until he resurfaces in the epilogue of ''A Dance with Dragons''.\n*Tyrion is not smuggled to the ship in a crate. When the ship reaches its destination, he is bundled into a barrel.\n*Following Tyrion's escape, his loyal squire [[Podrick Payne]] leaves the city in search for him. Pod hears from Brella, the only of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]'s maids who was not a spy of Cersei, that [[Brienne]] looks for Sansa. Pod goes after Brienne and eventually joins her, hoping that finding Sansa will lead to Tyrion.\n*There is a foreshadowing of Tywin's death in the First Volume ''&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;'' and the TV episode &quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;: after Tyrion tells the story about Tysha (still unaware that she was not a whore), [[Bronn]] comments &quot;I would have killed the man who did that to me&quot;.\n\n", "History": "===Prelude===\n{{Quote|The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you're hereby sentenced to death.|Tywin Lannister passes the sentence.|The Mountain and the Viper}}\n\nTyrion is put on [[Second Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial]] for the [[Purple Wedding|murder of his nephew]], King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], which he did not commit. Realizing the whole spectacle is a rigged farce, he demands a [[Second Trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, his champion [[Oberyn Martell]] is defeated and killed, and therefore Tyrion is deemed to be guilty. He is sentenced to death by his father Tywin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the night on the eve of his execution, his brother Jaime\u00c2\u00a0suddenly enters his cell and frees him. Jaime instructs Tyrion that [[Varys]] will help him escape the city for Essos, and the two brothers hug and say goodbye. Instead, Tyrion decides to confront his father in the Tower of the Hand\u00c2\u00a0before leaving the city.\n\n===From scapegoat to kinslayer===\n{{Dialogue a-b|Tywin Lannister|You shot me.........you are no son of mine.|Tyrion Lannister|I am your son.

Shae sleepily calls out &quot;Tywin,\u00c2\u00a0my lion&quot;, the name she had previously called Tyrion. When she spots him she grabs a\u00c2\u00a0dagger and they struggle. Tyrion disarms her and strangles her to death with the golden chain that he previously gave her (in the Season 3 episode [[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]])\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0around her neck. He immediately feels regret and apologizes to her corpse for what he has just done.\n[[File:Deadtywin.png|thumb|left|Tywin is shot dead by his own son]]\n\nTyrion takes Joffrey's crossbow from the wall and finds his father sitting on the privy. Tywin correctly intuits that [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] released him, because as Tywin noted, &quot;he always had a soft spot for you&quot;. He reassures Tyrion that he would never have allowed him to be executed, but enrages his son by dismissing Shae as a whore. Tyrion warns him not to call her that again. He demands to know why Tywin sentenced his own son to death, despite knowing that he did not kill Joffrey. Tywin does not answer, and again tries to placate Tyrion. But when he nonchalantly refers to Shae as a whore again,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion shoots him in the stomach. Stunned, a wounded Tywin hisses &quot;you are no son of mine&quot;. Tyrion retorts that he is, and always has been, Tywin's son (and effectively, Tywin's legacy). He reloads the crossbow and shoots his father in the heart, killing him.\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{Quote|What have you done?|Varys to Tyrion Lannister|The Children}}\n[[File:varyssitcrate.png|thumb|Varys sitting next to the crate Tyrion is in as their ship leaves King's Landing.]]\nTyrion goes to meet Varys, who\u00c2\u00a0knows he has done something horrible.
