The warhorn is made from an auroch's horn and is banded with bronze. On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even after Jon cleaned all the dirt out, he was unable to get any sound from it. The rim is chipped as well, but Jon gives to the horn to Sam anyway, since Sam likes to collect old things, even worthless ones. He tells Sam &quot;Make a drinking horn out of it, and every time you take a drink you'll remember how you ranged beyond the [[Wall]], all the way to the Fist of the First Men&quot;. Sam carries the warhorn all the way from the Fist to [[Castle Black]].\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\nThe warhorn is found along with spear and arrow heads made of [[dragonglass]], all wrapped in the black cloak of a brother of the [[Night's Watch]]. Sam and Grenn do not take notice of the warhorn, as they are more interested in the rare dragonglass weapons.\n\n"}, "title": "Old warhorn"}
