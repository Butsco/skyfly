He brought her to the Nightfort and bound the brothers of the Night's Watch to his will through sorcery. He declared himself &quot;Night's King&quot; and ruled over the Wall and [[The Gift]] as his own. The [[King in the North]] [[Brandon Stark (the Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]] and [[Joramun]], the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat him and his queen.\n\nAfter their deaths, it was discovered that they had been making human sacrifices to the Others - the White Walkers.\n\nAfter their defeat, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the Wall should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of the Night's King and Queen also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not &quot;rule&quot; the Wall but who serve the realms of men.\n\n", "Biography": "[[File:Night's_Queen_death.png|thumb|300px|The death of the Night's Queen at the hands of [[Brandon Stark (the Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]].]]\nAccording to legend, a [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Night's Watch]] found in the [[Haunted Forest]] a cold woman\u00c2\u00a0with bright blue eyes, seemingly a female [[White Walkers|White Walker]].
