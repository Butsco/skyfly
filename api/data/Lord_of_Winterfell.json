Lords of Winterfell have traditionally also served as [[Lord Paramount of the North|Lords Paramount of the North]] and as [[Warden of the North|Wardens of the North]]. As Lord Paramount of the North, the Lord of Winterfell is the ruler of the entire region of [[the North]] while as Warden of the North, he is tasked with defending [[Westeros]] from attacks from north of [[the Wall]].\n\nIn the past, the Lord of Winterfell was also given the title of the [[King in the North]], during its time as an [[Kingdom of the North|independent kingdom]]. A colloquial title also used for the Kings in the North was '''The Kings of Winter'''. [[House Stark]] ruled as Kings in the North for thousands of years, and they continue to serve as the Lords of Winterfell.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Rickard Stark]] held the title until he was murdered by [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When the series begins, Rickard's second son [[Eddard Stark]] is the holder until his death when the title passed to his eldest son, [[Robb Stark|Robb]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Following Eddard's execution under false acts of treason by King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], Robb Stark goes to war and leaves his eldest brother [[Bran Stark|Bran]] to be Lord of Winterfell in his absence. Robb stylizes himself '''King in the North''' like the Starks of old. Robb promises to avenge his father and separate the North from the rule of the [[Seven Kingdoms]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nDuring the [[War of the Five Kings]], [[Balon Greyjoy]] rises in rebellion against the [[Iron Throne]] and stylizes himself as [[King of the Iron Islands]]. King Balon sends his daughter [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] to seize [[Deepwood Motte]], his brother [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]] to seize [[Moat Cailin]] and his son [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] to raid the [[Stony Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, Theon decides to use an attack [[Torrhen's Square]] as a distraction. With Winterfell undefended, Theon seized the chance and took Winterfell as his own, making him the new Lord of Winterfell.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Lords of Winterfell": "*{[[Rickard Stark]]}\n*{[[Eddard Stark]]}\n*{[[Robb Stark]]}\n*[[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Roose Bolton]]\n\n===Historical Lords of Winterfell===\n*[[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Brandon the Builder]], legendary figure who according to myth began construction of Winterfell eight thousand years ago.\n*[[Torrhen Stark]], Lord of Winterfell during the Targaryen Conquest.\n*[[Cregan Stark]], Lord of Winterfell during the Dance of the Dragons.\n\n"}, "title": "Lord of Winterfell"}
