If his Lordship wants the helmet...|Tobho to [[Gendry]]|Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things}}\n'''Tobho Mott''' is a recurring character in the [[Season 1|first]] and [[Season 2|second]] seasons. He is played by guest star [[Andrew Wilde]] and debuts in &quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]].&quot; Tobho Mott is a master armorer and blacksmith in [[King's Landing]]. His apprentice [[Gendry]] is a [[bastardy|bastard]] son of Robert Baratheon. Tobho is tortured by the City Watch to reveal that Gendry fled the city in the wake of Robert's death.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tobho Mott is a native of the [[Free City]] of [[Qohor]] who learned to smith there, including the working of the fabled [[Valyrian steel]]. He moved to [[Westeros]] when younger and has successfully built up his own business thanks to his formidable skills. His armory is a large building at the top of the Street of Steel, impressive in size and outfittings.\n\nWhen Eddard Stark asked Mott who paid him Gendry's apprentice fee, Mott answered evasively, but eventually admitted it was [[Varys|a mysterious lord]] who did not identify himself that paid him both the apprentice fee and to keep his mouth shut about the youth.\n\nIn the books, Mott is not interrogated about Gendry's whereabouts. It is not explained how the Gold Cloaks knew that Gendry was with [[Yoren]]'s caravan.\n\nMott, not a smith from Volantis, is the one who melts [[Ice]] to forge two new swords at [[Tywin Lannister]]'s order.\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season One Appearances|4=yes}}\n{{Season Two Appearances|yes}}\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Gallery": "\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nGendry 1x04.png|Gendry working in Tobbo Mott's blacksmith forge.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nTobho Mott is a master armorer and blacksmith living in the city of [[King's Landing]]. Despite being a foreigner from the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Qohor]], he is well-regarded for the quality of his work and has received the patronage of many knights and even some lords. Mott is assisted by his apprentice smith, a young man named [[Gendry]].\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Eddard Stark]] learns that his predecessor [[Jon Arryn]] visited Mott prior to his death. Stark goes to question Mott and learns that Arryn displayed a particular interest in [[Gendry]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Stark later realizes that Gendry is the bastard son of King Robert Baratheon. Robert is killed and Gendry joins the Night's Watch.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nMott is forcibly questioned and tortured by the [[City Watch|Gold Cloaks]] about the whereabouts of [[Gendry]]. He tells [[Janos Slynt]] that Gendry joined the [[Night's Watch]] and that he can be recognized by the bull-shaped helm he sports. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n===[[Season 3]]===\nWhen Gendry mentions to the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] that he apprenticed under Tobho, [[Thoros]]\u00c2\u00a0noted that Tobho charges double what the other smiths do. Gendry retorts this by saying it is because his work is twice the quality.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gendry says he is done serving men, because Tobho sold him to the [[Night's Watch]] - apparently unaware that he was made to leave for the Wall to avoid the upcoming purge of Robert's other bastard children.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Tobho Mott"}
