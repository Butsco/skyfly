It is located due east of Oldtown on a tributary of the [[Honeywine]], amongst the foothills of the [[Red Mountains]] (which give it its name). House Mullendore is a vassal of [[House Hightower]] of Oldtown rather than the Tyrells directly.\n\nSer Mark Mullendore of Uplands was a noted [[knight]] in the service of [[Renly Baratheon]], noted for his trained black-and-white monkey. He switched allegiance to [[Stannis Baratheon]] after Renly's death. He lost an arm in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and was taken prisoner by the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. He bent the knee and swore fealty back to the [[Iron Throne]].\n\n"}, "title": "Uplands"}
