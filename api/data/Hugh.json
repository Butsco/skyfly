Ser Barristan explains that he did stand vigil alone, but Ser Hugh apparently has a mother in the Vale and the remains are being sent to her. Ser Hugh's armor is new since he had it made especially for the tournament and has not been completely paid for, but Lord Stark will deal with the armorer himself and insists to the Silent Sister accompanying the cart that Ser Hugh's mother receive his armor since he knows it will mean something to her.\n\nWhen [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] is being accused by [[Tyrion Lannister]] of fatally poisoning Jon Arryn, Pycelle denies it while accusing Ser Hugh of doing it and that [[Varys]]\u00c2\u00a0and Queen [[Cersei]] will concur with Pycelle about Ser Hugh's guilt.\n\nUpon being knighted, Ser Hugh's sigil is a blue field bordered in crescent moons.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{dialogue a-b|Petyr Baelish|Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?
