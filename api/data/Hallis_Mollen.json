He has a tendency to state the obvious.\n\nIn the books, Hallis goes south with [[Robb Stark]]'s army and takes part in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]]. Hallis actually accompanies Catelyn south when she goes to treat with [[Renly Baratheon]] at [[Storm's End]]. After Catelyn receives [[Eddard Stark]]'s bones at [[Riverrun]], she orders Hallis to escort them back to Winterfell for proper burial in the crypts. In the TV series, Ned Stark's bones are delivered instead by Littlefinger, at Tyrion's request, at Renly's camp in the Stormlands. No mention is made of what happened to Ned Stark's bones after Catelyn flees the camp after Renly's death with only [[Brienne of Tarth]] (though in the TV version, she may have simply sent Hallis away from the camp with Ned's bones before Renly was killed).\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\n\nSer [[Rodrik Cassel]] suggests to [[Catelyn Stark]] that if she is heading south to capture [[Tyrion Lannister]], she should take &quot;Hal&quot; and a squad of guardsmen with her.

Instead, Catelyn only allows Rodrik himself to accompany her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Hallis Mollen"}
