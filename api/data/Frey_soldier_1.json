While [[Frey soldier 2|one of the other men]] doesn't immediately believe this, saying that many of the Frey men would claim to have done the act, the soldier insists that with help from [[Malcolm]] and [[Talbot]], he sowed Grey Wind's head onto Robb's body, mentioning how difficult it was to do so.\n\n[[Arya Stark]], who passes the Freys along with [[Sandor Clegane]], jumps off the horse and walks up to the Freys, engaging in a conversation. She asks for a meal, whereas one of the soldiers simply orders her to &quot;fuck off&quot;. Arya states that she is hungry, and the Frey soldier asks her what part of &quot;fuck off&quot; she doesn't understand. Arya claims to have money, showing the coin of [[Braavos]]\u00c2\u00a0that [[Jaqen H'ghar]] gave her.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe Frey soldier seems interested, reaching his hand out for the coin. Arya, however, drops the latter by 'accident' and apologizes. The soldier calls her a &quot;little shit&quot;\u00c2\u00a0and leans down to retrieve the coin. Before even grasping it, Arya pulls the man off of the wooden log and repeatly stabs him in the neck. As the other Frey soldiers join the battle, Clegane intervenes and protects the Stark girl, eliminating each and every one of them as the stabbed Frey soldier bleeds profusely.\n\nAfter the battle is over, Sandor walks over to Arya, who is coldly staring down at the corpse of the Frey soldier she stabbed. He asks her if this was the first man she'd ever killed. After she confirms that it was the &quot;[[Stableboy|first ''man'']]&quot;, he asks where she retrieved the knife. She reveals that she pocketed it off of Clegane himself. Mildly annoyed, he grabs his knife back from her, and declares that the next time she plans on doing something like this, she should ''tell'' him first. She retrieves Jaqen's coin and mumbles the words ''Valar Morghulis''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Frey soldier 1"}
