After an hour of waiting in the [[Red Keep]], the two ambassadors were introduced to [[Mira Forrester]]. Andros was unhappy with this, claiming that [[House Forrester]] had no business selling ironwood to the crown, and demanding that any sale of ironwood go through House Whitehill. Morgryn tried to calm Andros, but Tyrion ended his meeting with them in order to deal directly with Mira. After attempting to threaten Mira, Andros left the Red Keep unsatisfied.\n\n"}, "title": "Andros"}
