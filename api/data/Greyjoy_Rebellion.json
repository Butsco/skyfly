Lord Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands calculated that Robert's rule was as yet insecure and that many families would not go to war for a [[usurper]]. Balon declared independence from the control of the [[King on the Iron Throne]]. When Robert mobilized his armies, the [[ironborn]] launched several preemptive strikes, destroying the [[Lannister]] navy at anchor in the harbor of Lannisport and raiding the castle of Seagard, as well as many smaller attacks along the coast. However, Stannis Baratheon and Paxter Redwyne, with their fleets from Dragonstone, Storm's End and the Arbor, defeated the ironborn fleet in a significant battle off [[Fair Isle]]. A large army assaulted the Greyjoy castle of Pyke, with the [[Red Priest]] Thoros of Myr and a brave [[Northmen|Northman]] knight named Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] the first through the breach, both surviving to win high honor. Pyke was severely damaged and Lord Greyjoy's eldest two sons were killed before he finally surrendered and bent the knee. King Robert agreed to forgive Balon and restore him to the king's peace as long as his surviving son and heir Theon was given up to Lord Eddard Stark as hostage and a [[ward]].\n\n", "History": "The rebellion took place nine years&lt;ref name=&quot;E5&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; before the beginning of the series and was an attempt by [[House Greyjoy]] of the [[Iron Islands]] to break away and secure independence from the [[Iron Throne]]\u00c2\u00a0and revive the [[Old Way (ironborn)|Old Way]].
