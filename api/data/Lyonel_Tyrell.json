She chose to remain neutral during the civil war, thus the Reach was divided between the supporters of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] and those of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]].\n\nDecades later, Lyonel commanded the army that invaded Dorne via [[Prince's Pass]]. After the Young Dragon's initial victory, Daeron appointed Lyonel as governor of Dorne. The Dornishmen however proved cunning and impossible to rule, particularly under a Reachman - the Reach and Dorne having been bitter enemies for centuries. Thus, Lord Lyonel moved with his train from one keep to the next, chasing rebels out and keeping the knees of the Dornishmen bent. It was his custom to turn the lords of the keeps he stayed in out of their chambers and sleep in their place. One night at [[Sandstone]], seat of [[House Qorgyle]], finding himself in a bed with a heavy velvet canopy, he pulled a sash near the pillows to summon a wench. When he did so, the canopy opened and a hundred red scorpions fell upon him. His death sparked new revolts, and in a fortnight all the work of the Young Dragon was undone, eventually bringing the about the death of King Daeron himself.\n\n", "TOP": "Lyonel Tyrell030267qacpxepydk9arc8cxxzdvidqku9lrry1781132015-03-20T15:26:00ZHurricaneHero9319478141{{Heraldry\n|image=Tyrell mini shield.png\n|link=House Tyrell\n}}\n{{Character\n|Title = Lyonel Tyrell\n|Image=Lyonel Tyrell.png\n|Season= [[Histories &amp; Lore]]\n|Mentioned=&quot;[[House Martell (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;\n|Status= [[:Category:Status: Dead|Deceased]]\n|Titles = [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]]&lt;br&gt;[[Lord of Highgarden]]&lt;br&gt;[[Warden|Warden of the South]]&lt;br&gt;Steward of Dorne\n|Allegiance = [[House Tyrell]]&lt;br&gt;[[House Targaryen]]\n|Family = {[[Luthor Tyrell]]} - descendant&lt;br&gt;[[Mace Tyrell]] - descendant&lt;br&gt;[[Loras Tyrell]] - descendant&lt;br&gt;[[Margaery Tyrell]] - descendant}}\n{{Quote|Daeron the First succeeded at great cost and reigned in Dorne  for a few glorious months.
