Its fleet is one of the largest in the realm, behind only the King's Fleet and the Iron Fleet of the [[Iron Islands]]. The Arbor has a warm and pleasant climate, due to its position surrounded by water off Westeros's southern coast. This climate is ideal for viticulture, and the Arbor is home to vast vineyards. Locations on the Arbor include Starfish Harbor and Vinetown.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\nThe poisoned wine a wineseller in [[Vaes Dothrak]] uses to try to kill [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is said to have originated from the Arbor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nKing [[Stannis Baratheon]] composes a letter revealing the truth of [[Cersei Lannister]]'s incestuous relationship with her brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], and that Jaime is the real father of [[Joffrey Baratheon]], and orders that copies of the letter be sent to every corner of Westeros, &quot;from the Arbor to [[the Wall]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "The Arbor"}
