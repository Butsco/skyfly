Viewers/Rating", "previous": "Season 3"}, "sections": {"Plot": "\nThe [[War of the Five Kings]] is drawing to a close, but new intrigues and plots are in motion, and the surviving factions must contend with enemies not only outside their ranks, but within.\n\n[[King in the North]] [[Robb Stark]] is dead, betrayed by his own bannermen the [[House Bolton|Boltons]] and [[House Frey|Freys]] while he was a [[Guest right| guest]] under the Freys' roof. Robb's mother [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and his wife [[Talisa Maegyr Stark|Talisa]], along with most of the Northern leadership were also killed at the massacre now known as the [[Red Wedding]], along with the entire Northern army.\n\nHaving already defeated the Baratheon threat at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and secured southern Westeros, [[House Lannister]] stands triumphant. The crazed boy-king [[Joffrey Baratheon]] gloats, though the victory truly belongs to his grandfather, Lord [[Tywin Lannister]], [[Hand of the King]] and the real power behind the [[Iron Throne]]. As reward for their betrayal, Tywin has granted the Boltons rule of [[the North]], and the Freys with nominal rule of [[Riverrun]], though the castle remains under the command of [[Brynden Tully|&quot;Blackfish&quot; Tully]].\n\nThough the mainland of [[Westeros]] is mostly under Lannister control, there are still two factions defying them: the Greyjoys and the Baratheons. Ironborn occupiers remaining in the North are being hunted down by [[Ramsay Snow]], bastard son of [[Roose Bolton]]. Ramsay holds [[Theon Greyjoy]] hostage, horribly torturing him at whim, but [[Balon Greyjoy]] considers his son as good as dead.\n\n[[Stannis Baratheon]], as the rightful heir to his older brother King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], still refuses to surrender, despite having only the remnants of an army. However, following the advice of [[Melisandre]], he has focused his attention of the threat of the [[wildlings]] marching against [[the Wall]].\n\nThe Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with the key support of [[House Tyrell]] of [[the Reach]], which they won through promising a marriage-alliance between King Joffrey and [[Margaery Tyrell]], daughter of Lord [[Mace Tyrell]]. Queen Regent Cersei fears - correctly - that just as the Baratheons became dependent on the Lannisters after [[Robert's Rebellion]], the Lannisters are starting to become dependent on the Tyrells, who are already insinuating themselves into positions of power at [[King's Landing]]. A royal wedding is to be held between Joffrey and Margaery, which will [[Purple Wedding|confirm the future of the realm]].\n\nThe only two kingdoms which have remained entirely aloof from the war so far are [[the Vale of Arryn]] and [[Dorne]]. While [[Lysa Arryn]] chose to remain neutral, former [[Master of Coin]] and new [[Lord of Harrenhal]] [[Petyr Baelish]] has been sent by Lord Tywin to woo her with a marriage proposal, now that he's a high lord and a suitable match for the Lady Regent of the Vale. Nevertheless only Littlefinger knows what Littlefinger is plotting.\n\nFor their own part, [[House Martell]] of [[Dorne]] has loathed the Lannisters ever since the [[Sack of King's Landing]], when Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] raped and killed [[Elia Martell]] - sister of [[Doran Martell]], the ruling [[Prince of Dorne]] - and Lord Tywin did nothing to punish him. During the War of the Five Kings [[Tyrion Lannister]] prevented Dorne from declaring for any of House Lannister's enemies by sending Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to [[Sunspear]] as part of her betrothal to Prince [[Trystane Martell]], and in return, the Martells were promised a seat on the [[Small Council]]. To the consternation of the Lannisters, a large Dornish embassy arrives in King's Landing to claim their due - but instead of the elderly Prince Doran, his brash younger brother Prince [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn]] comes to claim the council seat. Oberyn loves the ladies, he loves the boys, but most of all he loved his sister Elia, and the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.\n\nMeanwhile, across the [[Narrow Sea]] in [[Slaver's Bay]], perhaps the greatest threat to Lannister rule is rapidly growing in strength. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] now commands not just three live [[dragons]] - who are starting to grow large enough to serve as decisive weapons of war - but also an army of eight thousand [[Unsullied]] warrior-eunuchs. For now, Queen Daenerys is carving a path through Slaver's Bay - not of conquest but of liberation. As functionally once a slave herself, Daenerys is determined to free the downtrodden [[Slavery|slaves]] of the region. First [[Astapor]] and then [[Yunkai]] fell before Daenerys's forces, and hundreds of thousands of freed slaves now flock to her banner. Yet Daenerys must now face the last and greatest of the slaver-cities, [[Meereen]] - and unlike her previous victories, they have had time to prepare for her arrival.\n\nFar to the north, beyond the politics and meaningless feuds of the south, [[the Wall]] and the dwindling [[Night's Watch]] are all that stand between the Seven Kingdoms and the horrors beyond. The [[White Walkers]] have emerged in force, leading their armies of [[Wights]]. The [[Free Folk|wildlings]] have rallied behind [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] [[Mance Rayder]] in an attempt to flee south, knowing that as the White Walkers advance, anyone who remain in the lands [[beyond the Wall]] will die and become part of the undead host. Mance's wildling army now numbers in the tens of thousands, and is determined to force its way through the Wall to reach the safety of the south. All that stands between the Seven Kingdoms and this barbarian invasion is the Night's Watch, whose numbers and leadership were recently devastated with the deaths of a third of their number and that of Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]]. [[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] do what they can to prepare [[Castle Black]] for the [[Battle of Castle Black|massive wildling attack]].\n\nNot only are the Night's Watch outnumbered and their remaining leadership fractured, but advanced raiding bands of wildlings have infiltrated ''behind'' the Wall by climbing over it, preparing to attack the weakly defended southern side of Castle Black. These warbands are led by [[Tormund Giantsbane]] and the fearsome [[Styr]], Magnar of [[Thenn]] - as well as Jon Snow's ex-lover [[Ygritte]], whom he betrayed when he revealed his true loyalty and returned to the Night's Watch.\n\nIn the Seven Kingdoms, while House Stark stands on the verge of extinction - and is believed to be just that by the realm at large - four &quot;lone wolves&quot; fight to survive: [[Sansa Stark]] remains a hostage of the Iron Throne and a forced marriage to [[Tyrion Lannister]], [[Rickon Stark]] seeks the safety of [[Last Hearth]] and the fiercely loyal [[House Umber]], [[Bran Stark]] and [[Hodor|his]] [[Meera Reed|three]] [[Jojen Reed|companions]] have crossed [[the Wall]] chasing a vision, and [[Arya Stark]], having lost everything and forced to rely on the protection of a [[Sandor Clegane|man she hates]], clings to survival and her thirst for vengeance.\n\n", "Media release": "\nSeason 4 of ''Game of Thrones'' will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States on February 17th, 2015.

This decreases the number of countries that the TV series films in from four to three (Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Iceland).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2013/12/20/across-the-narrow-sea.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco was used for the location filming of Daenerys's Season 3 scenes set in [[Slaver's Bay]], specifically the cities of [[Astapor]] and [[Yunkai]]. Daenerys's storyline continues to take place in Slaver's Bay during Season 4, but other locations (apparently in Croatia) will be used to represent it.\n\nFor Season 3, apparently due to the increased workload of concurrent filming in four countries, the number of production units was increased from two to three. The first two units, organized since the beginning of the TV series, are &quot;Wolf&quot; unit and &quot;Dragon&quot; unit. The new third production unit in Season 3 was called &quot;Raven&quot; unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/10/mgot-three-filming-units-confirmed/ Winter is Coming]&lt;/ref&gt; Filming in Iceland actually began in Season 2. However, a post on the official Making Game of Thrones blog on September 25th, 2013, revealed that Season 4 would switch back to having only two units, and the extra &quot;Raven&quot; unit would be disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2013/9/25/get-ready-for-season-4.html Making Game of Thrones blog], Get Ready for Season 4, September 25th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe original reason that production expanded to location-shoots in Iceland in Season 2 was apparently to accurately portray the rugged frozen vistas of the lands [[beyond the Wall]], i.e. when Jon Snow, Qhorin Halfhand, or Ygritte are walking on an actual frozen glacier with rugged mountains in the background, without the need for special effects shots to fill those details in (which it was feared would look fake). However, the location scouts found other areas in Iceland which they felt would be perfect for scenes from the other storylines. While scenes beyond the Wall were filmed in Iceland during the winter, they production team realized that during the summer melt, Iceland has many pristine landscapes and lush valleys suitable for filming other locations in Westeros. The wilding raiding party containing Ygritte and Tormund filmed in Iceland during the winter for their scenes north of the Wall: in Season 4 they have returned to Iceland but in the summer, to depict the somewhat warmer lands of [[the Gift]] immediately south of the Wall. Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane's storyline, as well as Brienne of Tarth's storyline, will also include some scenes filmed in Iceland (representing parts of the Riverlands, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/02/game-of-thrones-explores-the-intensity-of-iceland/ Game of Thrones Season 4: Artisan Piece #2 - Intensity of Iceland]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Adaptation===\n\nAs [[David Benioff]] explained talking to EW.com, the producers were very excited to film Season 4, and the last three episodes in particular are scenes that - like the [[Red Wedding]] - they had been\u00c2\u00a0waiting to film since production on the first season began. Generally, the TV show has aimed to adapt roughly one book as one TV season, though the producers have also said they are adapting the story as a whole and thus parts will spill over into other seasons (i.e. Jaime Lannister didn't have much to do in the second novel, so they moved up some scenes he had from the beginning of the third novel into late Season 2). The third novel, ''A Storm of Swords'', was so long that the decision was made to split it into two seasons. One of the reasons the Red Wedding was so shocking to book readers was because it didn't happen near the end of the third novel, not at the point readers would expect such a climax. However the decision was made that Season 3 needed to have a climax and it would better suit their needs to make it the climax at the end (as opposed to putting in in the fifth episode out of ten, for shock value, similar to how abruptly [[Renly Baratheon]] died in the fifth episode of Season 2). Season 1's climax was Ned Stark's execution, Season 2's climax was the Battle of the Blackwater, thus the Red Wedding fit in as a good climactic point for the end of Season 3. Therefore, Season 3 was only the first half of the third novel, while Season 4 will adapt the second half - the half with the ''actual'' climaxes from the end of the third novel. Many storylines are left irrevocably changed by the end of the third novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/19/game-of-thrones-team-season-4-will-be-best-yet/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAlthough the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels were originally planned as a trilogy, to be titled ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Dance with Dragons''\u00c2\u00a0and ''The Winds of Winter'', eventually George R.R. Martin realized his plot of &quot;book one&quot;\u00c2\u00a0would have to be expanded into three novels\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;(''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings''\u00c2\u00a0and ''A Storm of Swords''), which effectively means\u00c2\u00a0the first three books are one very long novel. In fact, the climax of ''A Storm of Swords'' concludes many of the plotlines begun in ''A Game of Thrones''. Martin even initially planned to make a five-year time jump between the third and fourth novels, to emphasize how much of a chapter-break the climaxes of the third novel were to the overall story (though the time jump was later abandoned). Thus, David Benioff said he was very confident about Season 4, because it contains many climactic scenes which not only ended the third novel (to a ''greater extent'' than the Red Wedding), but concluded storylines begun in Season 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/19/game-of-thrones-team-season-4-will-be-best-yet/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Cast===\n:''Main article: [[Season 4

Neither includes particularly significant information or character interactions (in contrast with the Season 2 deleted scene that focused on Loras's mourning at Renly's death, or the Season 3 deleted scene in which the Lannister Small Council discusses the wildling army gathering at the Wall).&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/watch-two-deleted-scenes-game-thrones-season-4/ Watch two deleted scenes from Game of Thrones Season 4]&lt;/ref&gt; \n\n*The first deleted scene is from &quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot; and is about 60 seconds long.  It follows immediately after Tyrion breaks up with Shae and has Bronn take her away for a ship sailing to Pentos.  After Bronn leaves with Shae, they are in the gardens outside of her chambers and she is still crying.  He tries to comfort her by asking if she really thought her relationship with Tyrion would last forever, that &quot;these people, even the good ones&quot; use common people as they please, and when they're no longer any use they spit them out and find someone else they like.  Bronn points out that there you don't see any old sellswords, new faster ones keep coming up, and you've got to adapt to new circumstances or perish.  Shae ignores him, but then he gently urges that they have to get to her ship and they leave.  \n*The second deleted scene is from &quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot; and is about 45 seconds long.  It follows immediately after Daenerys exiles Ser Jorah and he is seen riding away from the city.  Later that night, Daenerys is on the balcony of her apartment at the top of the Great Pyramid, staring out at the horizon.  Despite the anger that she showed in the courtroom when she exiled him, in private it is seen that she is in shock at his betrayal, and at having to lose him.  Missandei arrives, sees she is upset, and asks if she can get her anything.  Daenerys numbly mutters &quot;never betray me&quot;, and continues to stare vacantly at the horizon that Jorah rode away into.\n\n", "Awards": "\n''Game of Thrones'' Season 4 received 20 Emmy Award nominations, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/07/10/game-thrones-picks-20-emmy-nominations/ Game of Thrones picks up 20 Emmy nominations!]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n*Outstanding Drama Series\n*Outstanding Supporting Actress \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; [[Lena Headey]] (Queen [[Cersei Lannister]])\n*Outstanding Supporting Actor \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; [[Peter Dinklage]] ([[Tyrion Lannister]])\n*Outstanding Guest Actress \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; [[Diana Rigg]] ([[Olenna Tyrell]])\n*Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B.
