They form a barrier between [[Dorne]] to the south and the [[Stormlands]]\u00c2\u00a0and [[the Reach]] to the north and west. There are two major passes through the mountains, the [[Prince's Pass]] and the [[Boneway]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Red Mountains are a formidable obstacle to travel between Dorne and the rest of Westeros. The northern face of the range is scattered with castles designed to defend against Dornish raids. This area is called the Dornish Marches and is part of the Stormlands.\n\nThe Red Mountains are noted as being visible from both the Tower of Joy and also [[Summerhall]]. They are so-called for the red-colored stone prevalent in the region.\n\n"}, "title": "Red Mountains"}
