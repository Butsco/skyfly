It was in this location where Valyrians, then a community of shepherds, first discovered [[dragons]].\n\nThe Fourteen Fires exploded four hundred years ago in a massive volcanic eruption, a cataclysmic event known as the [[Doom of Valyria]], which destroyed the Valyrian civilization and shattered the Valyrian peninsula. The entire region was consumed by the oceans, creating the [[Smoking Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valyria and the Dragons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", " See also ": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Fourteen Fires"}
