That stuff is great to play. When Ned asks Varys who he truly serves, and Varys answers, &quot;The realm,&quot; I think that's true. There's a moral code there... He sees in Tyrion someone who plays the game well, and Varys loves playing the game. Ned was too honorable and too good - he disdained the game.|'''Conleth Hill''' on playing Varys&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n'''Conleth Hill''' (born 24 November 1964) is a Northern Irish film, stage and television actor.
