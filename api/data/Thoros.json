He is played by [[Paul Kaye]]. Thoros is a [[Red Priest|red priest]] of the [[Lord of Light]] and a noted warrior.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Thoros is described as tall, fat, shaved bald, and wearing loose fitting red robes so faded that they appear pink.\u00c2\u00a0After some time spent in the Brotherhood, he becomes a loose-skinned, grey-haired man in faded robes and piecemeal armor.\u00c2\u00a0Thoros originally was sent to [[Westeros]] by his order to convert King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] to the faith of R'hllor, because of the King's obsession with fire. However, his efforts to preach his religion were in vain, and combined with the atrocities of Aerys' reign he came to question his own faith and grew despondent. Following [[Robert's Rebellion]], Thoros became a regular hanger-on in the court of King [[Robert Baratheon]], kept on in part due to his martial skills. King Robert was also fond of keeping around various interesting foreign visitors as drinking companions, so Thoros also stayed at court due to the good will he enjoyed with Robert.\n\nDuring his time in [[King's Landing]] Thoros became a noted tourney champion, besting many skilled opponents with his flaming sword, such as [[Sandor Clegane]], who is afraid of fire. Despite his many victories, and popularity with the King, Thoros earned the animosity of master blacksmith [[Tobho Mott]], who regarded Thoros' habit of dousing his blades in [[wildfire]] - which subsequently wrecked the steel - as desecration of his work.\n\nThoros competes in the [[tournament|Tourney]] of the Hand, unseating [[Beric Dondarrion]] in the joust. The next day he wins the melee competition. Eddard Stark orders Thoros to accompany Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] to arrest Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] for his raids in the [[Riverlands]]. Though Beric briefly appeared in the same scene in the TV series, Thoros was absent.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "Thoros was an unseen character in the [[Season 1|first season]].

Being an eighth son, Thoros' father had no means to support him and gave him up to the local [[Red Temple|Temple]] of the [[Lord of Light]]. There, he was raised to become a [[Red Priest]], though he grew up a glutton and lustful man, constantly raiding the kitchens and taking girls to his chambers.\n\nHe was tasked by the [[High Priest of R'hllor|High Priest]] to turn future King [[Robert Baratheon]] away from [[the Seven]] and convert him to the Lord of Light. He was already present in the [[Red Keep]] by the time the bodies of [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (Son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]] were presented to Robert. Thoros became part of the court and a drinking and whoring companion of King Robert. He also became famous for using a sword coated with [[wildfire]] and set ablaze before combat as a way of intimidating his enemies.\n\nHe fought for King [[Robert Baratheon]] in the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. He was the first man, followed closely by\u00c2\u00a0[[Jorah Mormont|Ser Jorah Mormont]], through the breach during the\u00c2\u00a0[[Siege of Pyke]], stabbing and terrifying the [[ironborn]] with his flaming sword.&lt;ref name=&quot;E4&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Jory Cassel]] and [[Jaime Lannister]] reminisce about the [[Siege of Pyke]].

Interested on how they managed to escape from [[Harrenhal]], he convinces the children to come with them at a local inn.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Sandor Clegane]] is captured by the Brotherhood, and he reveals the true identity of Arya to them. The Brotherhood tries to convict Sandor of crimes because of his long service to the [[Lannisters]], but know of no evil Sandor had personally done to them.\u00c2\u00a0[[Arya]] speaks up, and accuses him of killing her friend [[Mycah]]. He is placed on [[trial by combat]]\u00c2\u00a0by [[Beric Dondarrion]]. After Clegane kills Beric during the fight, Thoros quickly calls upon the Lord of Light to revive Beric, repeatedly chanting\u00c2\u00a0&quot;''LORD cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished, restore it!''&quot;, and in a few short seconds, Beric is alive and breathing again, his wounds healed as well.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Jorah Mormont|Ser Jorah Mormont]] mentions the Siege of Pyke and Thoros's flaming sword when reminiscing about his knighthood with [[Barristan Selmy|Ser Barristan Selmy]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome time later, the Brotherhood is found by [[Melisandre]], who is looking for a blood relative ([[Gendry]]) of [[Stannis Baratheon]], in order to be able to create more [[Shadow]]s. She is surprised to find Thoros among them, and berates him for giving up on his mission to convert King Robert to their religion. Thoros takes her to Beric, where she examines him and realizes that he has been brought back from death. When she asks Thoros how many times he brought him back, he responds with six. Stunned, she claims that he should not have that kind of power, to which he simply remarks that he has no power, he only asks the Lord for favors, and the Lord responds. Thoros then confesses how he had always had a large lack of faith in the Lord of Light and never took his duties seriously because of them, until the day that [[Gregor Clegane]] killed Beric, his friend, and Thoros was called upon him to revive him. When he saw that it worked, Thoros's faith was restored.\u00c2\u00a0Melisandre convinces Beric and Thoros to give her Gendry in exchange for gold, and because the Lord of Light requires him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nArya Stark could not forgive Thoros and Beric for selling Gendry to Melisandre.
