Disparagingly called &quot;frog-eaters&quot; because their lands are in the swamps of [[the Neck]], the Reeds and the crannogmen keep to themselves and rarely travel beyond their borders. However, Howland Reed was an exception to this, becoming a noted friend and ally of Lord [[Eddard Stark]], fighting at his side during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. He remains one of House Stark's staunchest supporters but, so far, hasn't played a role in the [[War of the Five Kings]].\n\nOf one point of note mentioned in the books is the fact that Howland Reed was with Ned when he finally rescued [[Lyanna Stark]]. Howland was one of only two survivors of that mission; the other was Ned himself.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "Howland is mentioned in a press release accompanying the news of the casting of Meera and Jojen Reed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/13/game-of-thrones-casting_n_1672550.html?ref=topbar Huffington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nHe is the Lord of [[Greywater Watch]] and the father of [[Meera Reed|Meera]] and [[Jojen Reed]].
