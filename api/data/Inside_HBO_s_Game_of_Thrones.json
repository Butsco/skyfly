It was published by Chronicle Books in the USA on 19 September 2012 and by Gollancz in the UK on 27 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;June 2012. [http://www.gollancz.co.uk/2012/06/gollancz-goes-inside-game-of-thrones/ &quot;Gollancz Goes Inside 'Game of Thrones'&quot;]. Gollancz.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe book is written by [[Bryan Cogman]], who has also written two episodes of the series and serves as &quot;keeper of the mythos&quot; for the production. The book has an introduction by showrunners [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]], and a preface by [[George R.R. Martin]]. As the official companion book to the series, information presented in this volume is treated as canon by this Wiki, unless contradicted by in-episode information.\n\nThe book contains in-universe material, such as family trees and maps, and behind-the-scenes sections, including interviews with cast and crew. It is 192 pages long and features more than 300 color photographs and illustrations, as well as eight gatefold sections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Official_HBO_Game_of_Thrones_Companion_Book_Announced/ &quot;Offical HBO 'Game of Thrones' Companion Book Announced&quot;]. Westeros.org.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe book covers information from [[Season 1]] and [[Season 2]]. It was published about six months before [[Season 3]] premiered, so it contains no information on subsequent TV seasons. A sequel book is due by Christmas 2014, ''[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 &amp; 4]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/01/hbo-announces-new-inside-game-of-thrones-book/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Layout": "The book contains a preface by George R.R.
