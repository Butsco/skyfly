He will be played by [[Michael Condron]].\u00c2\u00a0Bowen Marsh is the First Steward of the [[Night's Watch]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Marsh, nicknamed &quot;the Old Pomegranate,&quot; is an important and senior figure in the Watch, reporting directly to Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] and is just below him in the command hierarchy of the Watch. When Mormont and the rest of the Night's Watch ride out to investigate the [[wildling]] menace in the so-called &quot;[[Great Ranging]]&quot;, he remains in command at Castle Black. Though not explicitly stated, Bowen Marsh hails from House Marsh, a noble house from [[the Neck]] sworn to [[House Reed]].\n\nAs the [[Wildling]]s advance to Castle Black, [[Mance Rayder]] sends raiding parties the to attack several areas of the Wall, in order to draw attention away from the main host and to draw away the defenders. Unfortunately, Marsh falls for the trick and takes most of the garrison from Castle Black. When [[Jon Snow]] returns, he finds that only forty-one men are left in the castle, most of them old, cripple and inexperienced.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "During Season 1 it was believed that [[Brian Fortune]] was playing Marsh, and\u00c2\u00a0[[Dennis McKeever]] was playing [[Othell\u00c2\u00a0Yarwyck]], based on comments by Fortune and McKeever's character delivering\u00c2\u00a0a line said by Yarwyck in the books. Neither of them were absolutely confirmed to be playing these characters, however, as their names were never stated in on-screen dialogue or in the credits. McKeever reappeared in Seasons [[Season 2|2]] and [[Season 3|3]] in a background role in the [[Great Ranging]], in which Yarwyck didn't partake. In [[Season 4]], Fortune's character was directly identified in on-screen dialogue as Yarwyck, and [[Michael Condron]] was subsequently cast as Marsh for [[Season 5]]. This establishes that Fortune's character should always be considered to have been Yarwyck, while McKeever was simply playing [[Night's Watch Officer 2|an unnamed Night's Watch officer]]. While this might technically be a retcon, Season 1 never absolutely confirmed which characters these actors were playing, so it introduced no internal continuity errors.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Appearances": "\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nBowen Marsh is the First Steward of the [[Night's Watch]], based at [[Castle Black]].
