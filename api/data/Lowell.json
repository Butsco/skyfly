Lowell is sitting down at a table, eating some chicken as [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane]] and [[Arya Stark]] walk in.\n\nAfter Sandor argues with Polliver about giving him a free chicken, Polliver offers a trade - a chicken in return for letting the Lannister men take turns molesting Arya. He then gestures to Lowell, saying that he likes the girls he molests to be &quot;broken in&quot; beforehand. This ultimately leads to a brawl between Sandor and the soldiers. Lowell attempts to fight back, but is violently punched in the mouth by Sandor and he falls to the floor. After getting back up, Lowell again tries to swing at Sandor, but Sandor instead parries Lowell's sword into the crotch of another soldier. Lowell proceeds to tackle Sandor to the ground and holds a knife to his throat, but Sandor fights back and uses Lowell's own blade to stab him in the eyes multiple times, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Lowell"}
