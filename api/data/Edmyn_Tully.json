He is long dead by the time depicted in the TV series. Lord Edmyn Tully was the [[Lord of Riverrun]] and a vassal of King [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]], though he rebelled against him when [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] [[Wars of Conquest|invaded]] [[Westeros]].\n\nAfter the elimination of Harren and his entire line at the [[Burning of Harrenhal]], Aegon rewarded Edmyn by elevating the Tullys to rule over [[the Riverlands]] (under the Targaryens), even though they had never ruled the Riverlands as kings - indeed, the Riverlands had been occupied by powerful neighboring kingdoms for centuries, and before that were rarely politically unified. Aegon made Edmyn Tully the first [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]], a title his family held ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/tully/ HBO viewers guide entry on House Tully]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Edmyn Tully's backstory is the same.\n\n"}, "title": "Edmyn Tully"}
