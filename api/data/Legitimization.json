For example, [[House Baratheon]] was founded by [[Orys Baratheon]], the legitimized bastard half-brother of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]].\n\nHowever, while bastards stand outside the lines of succession and inheritance, there are still exceptions which have caused immense problems. King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] legitimized three of his bastard sons and one of his bastard daughters on his deathbed. His eldest bastard son, [[Daemon Blackfyre]], later claimed the [[Iron Throne]] and led a bloody civil war known as the [[First Blackfyre Rebellion]]. His sons and descendants launched four more attempts to take the Iron Throne before their final claimant, Maelys the Monstrous, was slain by [[Barristan Selmy|Ser Barristan Selmy]] during the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. This is sometimes used as an example of what happens if a bastard is treated too well and given too much power and legitimacy. It should be noted that the social stigma is not automatically removed even after the formal legitimization is performed.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin has stated that in-universe, legitimization happens so rarely that there is no set legal principle for where a legitimized bastard ranks in the line of succession: whether they should go after all of a lord's trueborn children, or whether they should be placed according to birth order. For example, if Eddard Stark ever had [[Jon Snow]] legitimized, there is no established rule for whether Jon would go behind or ''ahead'' of his younger but trueborn half-brothers Bran and Rickon. In the case of the First Blackfyre Rebellion this was a moot point, because Daemon Blackfyre was not only bastard-born, but simply younger than Daeron II Targaryen. Daemon's followers therefore had to promote the rumor that Daeron II was himself a bastard of his father's younger brother.\n\n[[Robb Stark]] had planned to legitimize Jon Snow and name him his heir until a son was born to him from Jeyne Westerling. He signed the decree in the presence of several lords as witnesses. However, it is unknown what became of the decree, as it is no longer mentioned in the books. It is speculated that Robb gave it to [[Maege Mormont]] and [[Galbart Glover]], but their current location is unknown. So far Jon has not received the decree, and has no idea of its existence.\n\nIn the novels, Ramsay receives his decree of legitimacy signed by King [[Tommen Baratheon]] as a reward for the part his father played in the [[Red Wedding]], as he was in need of an heir after the death of his trueborn son [[Domeric Bolton|Domeric]] who apparently died of a stomach virus. Roose believes Ramsay to have poisoned Domeric out of jealousy of his status as their father's heir. He wins Ramsay's legitimacy despite this, as he believes that due to his age he will not live to see any children he might have with his new wife [[Walda Bolton|Walda]] live to adulthood, and suspects that Ramsay will kill them anyway. Ramsay is very sensitive to his origin, and reacts very violently if someone calls him &quot;bastard&quot; or &quot;Snow&quot;, even without offensive intention.\n\n", "History": "===\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;[[Season 1]]===\n\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;The infamous [[Great Bastards]], legitimized bastard children of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], are mentioned in ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\n[[Catelyn Stark]] tells [[Talisa Stark]] that when [[Eddard Stark|her husband]]'s bastard [[Jon Snow]] became ill as an infant, she prayed to the [[Faith of the Seven|Seven]] to let him live, and in return promised to love him and ask her husband to legitimize him.
