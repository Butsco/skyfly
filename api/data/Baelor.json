If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''Jon''': &quot;He... He would do whatever was right. No matter what.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''Aemon''': &quot;Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a ''brother's'' smile?&lt;br /&gt;\n'''Jon''': &quot;Sam told you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''Aemon''': &quot;We're all human.

I will not tell you...to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself, and live with it for the rest of your days. As I have.&quot;\n\n", "Summary": "[[File:Theon and Robb 1x09.jpg|right|190px|thumb|[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Robb Stark|Robb]] outside [[the Twins]].]]\n[[Varys]] visits [[Eddard Stark]] in the dungeons under the [[Red Keep]]. Varys tells Eddard that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] begged for his life before the whole court and that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] is leading an army from [[the North]]. In addition, the Queen is more concerned over the intentions of [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]]'s brother, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], a proven battle commander known to be without mercy. For the sake of Sansa's life, Varys urges Eddard to confess to treason. In return, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] will let him take the black and join his younger brother [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] and [[Bastardy|bastard]] son [[Jon Snow]] on [[the Wall]]. Eddard is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life, though he appears to have second thoughts when Varys insinuates that Sansa would pay the price for his defiance.\n\nRobb's army has reached [[the Twins]], the heavily-fortified crossing over the [[Green Fork]] of [[The Trident|Trident River]]. Theon Greyjoy shoots down messenger ravens, so no word of their presence can be relayed. To enter the castle would be perilous for Robb, so Catelyn Stark enters to negotiate to cross the river. Though held by [[House Frey]], bannermen to [[Catelyn Stark]]'s [[Hoster Tully|father]], Lord [[Walder Frey]] has not yet taken up arms. When called up, he says he had been preparing to march, and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive. In reality, he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved. Now, as the Tully's army has been defeated and [[Riverrun]] is held by the Lannisters, he wants to know why he should be helping Robb and taking up arms against the king. After some hard bargaining between Catelyn and Walder, they strike a deal: the Freys will join Robb's cause, allow him to cross and commit troops to his army, but in return both Robb and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] must each marry one of Walder's own children. Robb agrees, though noting that Arya won't like it. Robb must also take [[Olyvar Frey]] as a squire.                 \n[[File:Jon and Jeor.jpg|right|190px|thumb|[[Jeor Mormont]] gives his sword [[Longclaw]] to [[Jon Snow]].]]\n[[File:Aemon 1x09.jpg|right|190px|thumb|Maester [[Aemon]] reveals his true identity.]]\nAt [[Castle Black]], Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] gives Jon Snow a [[Valyrian]] steel sword, [[Longclaw]], in thanks for saving his life. Mormont also reinstates Jon to his former position and tells him he has dispatched Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] to [[King's Landing]] to lay the hand of the [[Wights|wight]] they found at the feet of the King and ask for aid. Mormont explains to Jon that Longclaw was meant for his own son, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to [[Essos]]. Jon goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword, but [[Samwell Tarly]] seems distant from the revelry. Sam takes Jon aside and informs him about Robb leading an army south to war. Jon ponders that he should be with him, but Maester [[Aemon]] tells him their duty to the [[Night's Watch]] comes first. To Jon's surprise, Aemon reveals that his full name is Aemon Targaryen, the son of a king, brother to another, the uncle of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. Aemon had to stand aside and do nothing while his entire family was butchered or exiled during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. It is not an easy life they have chosen. Aemon remarks that he cannot make Jon stay or go; like the Maester, Jon must make the choice himself, and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life.\n\nFar to the east, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is concerned that the wound her husband Khal [[Drogo]] took fighting [[Mago]] has festered and become infected. He falls from his horse, a grave sign of weakness amongst the [[Dothraki]]. Daenerys tells the khalasar that they are stopping and requests for [[Qotho]] to get [[Mirri Maz Duur]] to help Drogo. [[Qotho]] is unhappy with entrusting Drogo's care to the woman, whom he calls a ''maegi'' or witch, but relents.\n\nThe [[House Lannister|Lannister]] armies prepare for battle. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] tells his son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that he means to use the [[Hill tribes|hill tribe]] forces to give them an edge against the [[House Stark|Stark]] army, essentially to be used as cannon fodder. He orders Tyrion to lead them from the front of the vanguard. Tyrion angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him. He storms back to his tent to find that [[Bronn]] has found him, as per instruction, a [[Prostitution|whore]] named [[Shae]]. Tyrion takes an immediate liking to her. When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning, Bronn goes off to find one for himself.                \n[[File:Drogo's fall.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Drogo]] after his fall.]]\n[[File:Daenerys.png|right|190px|thumb|[[Jorah Mormont]] helps [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]].]]\nAt Daenerys' request, Ser Jorah armors himself. Jorah also advises her to leave now, because Drogo is certain to die and when he dies, his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill Daenerys's son, rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival, but Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband. Mirri Maz Duur promises to save Drogo's life, but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange. She takes Drogo's horse into his tent and starts the ceremony, slitting the animal's throat over Drogo's comatose form. Some of Drogo's warriors become enraged at what they see as Daenerys' attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and Qotho tries to attack her, but Ser Jorah kills him. Daenerys starts to go into labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives will help her, thinking she is cursed. With no choice, Jorah takes Daenerys into the tent as the ceremony continues.\n\nTyrion, Bronn, and Shae play a drinking game the night before the battle. Tyrion makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink. He guesses correctly that Bronn has been beyond the Wall and killed someone before he was twelve years old (though it was a woman, not a man, and he killed her in self-defense, because she was coming at him with an axe). Tyrion guesses that Shae's mother was a whore, her father deserted them, and she is low born - however he is wrong on each guess. Tyrion cannot read Shae's personality, but this only makes her more intriguing to him. When Shae starts to question Tyrion, [[Bronn]] reveals that he heard Tyrion was once married. Reluctantly, Tyrion explains that when he was very young, he and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] were out riding near [[Casterly Rock]] and found a young common girl in distress from bandits. While Jaime chased the bandits off, Tyrion comforted the girl, whose name was [[Tysha]]. They ended up getting drunk at a local inn, and she became so enamored of him that Tyrion felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf. Later that night she had sex with Tyrion, the first time he was ever with a woman. Tyrion fell madly in love, and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret. However, two weeks later his father Tywin found out, and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner. Tywin forced Jaime to reveal the truth: the girl was a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and Jaime set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother. Tywin then instructed his guards to have sex with her, with her being paid a silver coin for each man, while Tyrion was forced to watch. Shae points out that Tyrion was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped. As she gets romantic with Tyrion, Bronn leaves the tent.\n\nThe next morning the Lannister army finds that the Starks have stolen a march on them; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle. Tyrion gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen, but as they charge for the front he is first nearly trampled and then knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone's club. When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon, Bronn tells him that the Lannisters won the battle, but it was a feint. As a diversion, Robb sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay Tywin's forces, while the main army marched on [[Riverrun]] to attack Jaime's army.\n\n[[File:Jaime captured.png|thumb|190px|Jaime is captured by Robb's army.]]\n[[File:Robb_Stark_after_the_battle.jpg|right|thumb|190px|[[Robb Stark]] after his victory.]]\nCatelyn and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle. Suddenly Robb returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner, Jaime himself. The [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] has lifted the siege of Riverrun, and Jaime's army has been destroyed. Jaime suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and Robb, but Robb refuses and has him imprisoned. Robb laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths. He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory, but the war is far from over.\n\nIn King's Landing, [[Arya Stark]] is living rough on the streets of the city. She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread, to no avail. She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the [[Hand of the King]] is being brought before the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], the center of religious worship in the city. Stunned that she will see her father she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd. Unable to see, she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of Baelor (a previous Targaryen king, Baelor the Blessed, for whom the Sept is named). She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple. He sees Arya on the statue, and as he is dragged through the crowd he passes [[Yoren]] of the Night's Watch (who had met Arya). Lord Eddard looks at the statue and says, &quot;Baelor,&quot; puzzling the crowd. Yoren understands, however, and moves towards the statue where Arya is watching.\n\nEddard is given a chance to confess his &quot;crimes&quot;. He weighs up his choices as he sees both Arya and Sansa present, and chooses to save them by making a false confession. He says that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is the true King on the [[Iron Throne]], pleasing him. Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] extols the virtues of mercy and Joffrey agrees that he could be merciful and send Eddard to the Night's Watch as his mother has suggested and as Sansa has begged. He instead acknowledges that they are soft women and treason must never go unpunished. He commands Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] to bring him the traitor's head.                 \n[[File:Ned's execution.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] executes [[Eddard Stark]].]]\n\nThe crowd goes into an uproar. Arya tries to make her way through the crowd drawing her sword to save her father, but Yoren grabs and stops her, shielding her from seeing her father's death. Sansa screams and is restrained by guards. Cersei, shocked, tries to countermand Joffrey's order, as does Varys, but there is no time and Joffrey isn't listening. Forced to kneel, Eddard looks at the statue and sees that Arya has been rescued by Yoren, and is relieved that she is safe. Ser Ilyn draws Eddard's own sword, [[Ice]], and cuts his head off with a single blow.\n\n", "Notes": "* The episode title refers to the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], the grand seat of the [[Faith of the Seven]] in [[King's Landing]], and from [[Baelor Targaryen]], the King after whom the Great Sept was named.\n* Maester Aemon's count of the kings suggests that in the TV series the short rule of King Jaehaerys II has been eliminated, making the Mad King directly a son of King [[Aegon V Targaryen|Aegon V]] ('Egg' from the ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' prequel novellas by [[George R.R. Martin]]). Aemon even mentions 'Egg' by name.\n* In the novels, Shae is a native of Westeros, but in the TV series has been made into a native of Essos to account for actress [[Sibel Kekilli]]'s German accent. In the novels, Shae is around eighteen years old.\n[[Image:The Twins Title Sequence.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[The Twins]], as shown in the [[title sequence]].]]\n* The [[title sequence]] shifts again, this time dropping the [[Eyrie]] in favor of the Twins. However, for events in the east [[Vaes Dothrak]] continues to be used, although the narrative has moved far south and east of that city to [[Lhazar]].\n* [[Eddard Stark]]'s word to [[Yoren]] before he is executed, &quot;Baelor&quot;, refers to the statue of Baelor the Blessed, where Ned sees his daughter [[Arya Stark|Arya]]; thus signaling Yoren to protect her.\n* The lines spoken by Pycelle prior to Ned's execution were spoken by the High Septon in the books. The High Septon, nevertheless, is still present in the scene as Ned mentions him.\n* One of the more substantial alterations from the novel occurs in this episode in that Tyrion rather comically is knocked unconscious before he can take part in the fighting, whereas in the novel he is an active (if reluctant) participant and holds his own against several opponents. In addition, the original novel has Tyrion telling his story of being set up with a whore to Bronn shortly after leaving the Eyrie.\n* Eddard Stark, because of his death, remains one of the most talked about character in the show. After several seasons and episodes he is still referenced in some way by other characters.\n\n"}, "title": "Baelor"}
