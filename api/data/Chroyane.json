It is south of [[Dagger Lake]].  \n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Chroyane used to be the summer palace of the [[Rhoynar]] kingdom. Like most of the surrounding nation, it was destroyed by [[dragons]] unleashed by the Freehold of [[Valyria]] in its conquest of the area.\n\nChroyane today is a dreary ruin, frequently cloaked in mists. People infected with [[Greyscale|greyscale]] in nearby cities and towns and gather here.\u00c2\u00a0These people, known as &quot;Stone men&quot;, are highly contagious and tend to roam in an area known as Bridge of Dream, which is a crossing of the [[Rhoyne]]\u00c2\u00a0near the southern tip of the Sorrows, and attack travelers that sail through the river.\n\nThe area known as &quot;the Sorrows&quot; actually extends beyond the ruins of Chroyane, extending north along the river to the southern shores of Dagger Lake.  Most of the Stone men, however, tend to take shelter in the ruins of Chroyane.\n\n"}, "title": "Chroyane"}
