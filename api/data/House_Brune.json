House Brune of Dyre Den is the main branch of the family, though a [[Cadet branch|cadet branch]] known as House Brune of Broomhollow also exists at the time of the novels, also located in Crackclaw Point, though they are only landed knights, not noble lords. Their sigil is a brown bear claw on a white background, with a double brown line running around the edge.\n\nLothor Brune is a distant minor relative of House Brune of Broomhollow - itself a poor cadet branch of landed knights stemming from an already poor main family of minor nobles. It is therefore unsurprising that Lothor grew up poor and fighting for a living, explaining why he is a freerider serving another lord at the beginning of the story. After his father's death, Lothor tried to find a place with House Brune of Broomhollow, but they said he was no close kin of theirs and turned him away.\n\nSubsequently, however, Lothor's fortunes rise as a trusted and capable fighter in the retinue of Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish. He serves Baelish in King's Landing, and when he took part in the Tourney of the Hand he even managed to beat [[Jory Cassel]], captain of Eddard Stark's guards (though the victory was awarded as a judgement by King Robert after a very close match). Lothor performed very well at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], killing two knights of House Fossoway and capturing a third, and in reward Lothor received as [[Knighthood|knighthood]]. Ser Lothor accompanies Baelish back to the Vale after the [[Purple Wedding]]: Lothor commanded the team of crossbowmen on Baelish's ship that kill\u00c2\u00a0Dontos Hollard at Baelish's order (coincidentally, the same man Lothor was supposed to face at Joffrey's tournament).\n\n", "Members": "*[[Lothor Brune]] - a freerider in service to Petyr\u00c2\u00a0&quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\n[[Lothor Brune]] is a [[Mercenary#Freeriders|freerider]] in the service of [[Petyr Baelish]].
