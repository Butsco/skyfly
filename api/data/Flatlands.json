The [[Dothraki]] have easy access to the Flatlands and find riding across it easy, so Pentosi nobles pay them heavy tribute so as to ensure they do not loot or sack any of the estates or villages in the area.\n\nThe Flatlands used to be part of the southern kingdom of the [[Andals]] before they fled to [[Westeros]] several millennia ago.\n\n"}, "title": "Flatlands"}
