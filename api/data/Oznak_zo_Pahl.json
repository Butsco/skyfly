Linguist [[David J. Peterson]] confirmed this, though he modified a few words to match the scene (referring to Daenerys as the &quot;Dragon Queen&quot; and to &quot;Westeros&quot;). Peterson had to come up with Valyrian words for &quot;hamster&quot; and &quot;elderberry&quot;: the word for &quot;hamster&quot; is ''n\u0102\u02ddnyghi'' (which Peterson stated was inspired by the Knights Who Say Ni) and the word for &quot;elderberry&quot; is ''tomisto'', from High Valyrian ''t\u0139?m\u00c4\u0164tsos'', a reference to Peterson's friend Tommy Lieber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dothraki.com/2014/05/the-valyrian-word-for-hamster/ Dothraki.com], David J.

He is played by guest star [[Daniel Naprous]] and only appears in &quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Oznak zo Pahl is a noble from [[Meereen]] and a scion of the House of Pahl. He wields a 14-foot lance striped with the colors of his house (pink and white). It is rumored that he once cut the liver out of a man named Scarb who had looked at a Meereenese lady wrongly. Oznak claimed that he was defending the lady's honor, for Scarb had raped her with his eyes. No one dared to question Oznak's act since his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard.\n\nOznak is defeated by &quot;Strong&quot; Belwas instead of Daario Naharis, and the events play out slightly different. Daenerys chooses Belwas, a eunuch and former pit fighter, because he is the least important of her protectors, and because if Oznak should fall to such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if Belwas is defeated - it is a poor victory that Meereen can take no pride in. Belwas evades three of Oznak's charges before injuring his mount on the fourth, forcing him to fight on foot. He does not immediately kill the champion, as he allows his opponent to cut his belly once before finishing them off. He decapitates him, before defecating next to his corpse.\n\n", "Quotes": "\n{{Quote|Byjan vavi demble eva o, trezy eme verdje espo jimi!

Daenerys chooses [[Daario Naharis]], the least valuable of her party, to battle him. Daario Naharis defeats him by throwing a knife into the eye of Oznak's horse, causing it to fall and him with it.
