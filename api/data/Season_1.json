The action begins in the unified [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]] as the long summer ends and winter draws near. [[Eddard Stark|Lord Eddard Stark]] is asked by his old friend, [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert Baratheon]], to serve as the [[King's Hand]] following the death of the previous incumbent, Eddard's mentor [[Jon Arryn]]. Eddard is reluctant, but receives intelligence suggesting that Jon was murdered. Eddard accepts Robert's offer, planning to use his position and authority to investigate the alleged murder.\n\nMeanwhile, on the eastern continent of [[Essos]], the exiled children of [[House Targaryen]], which Robert destroyed to claim the throne, are plotting to return to Westeros and unseat the 'usurper'. To this end, [[Viserys Targaryen]] arranges the marriage of his sister [[Daenerys]] to [[Khal Drogo]], the leader of 40,000 [[Dothraki]] warriors, in return for the use of his warriors in invading Westeros. For her part, Daenerys just wants to find a safe refuge far away from King Robert's assassins and her brother's scheming ambition.\n\nFinally, on the northern-most border of the Seven Kingdoms the sworn brothers of the [[Night's Watch]] guard the [[Wall]], a 300-mile-long colossal fortification of ice which has stood for thousands of years. The Watch defends the Wall against the depredations of the lawless [[wildlings]] who live beyond, but rumor speaks of a new threat arising in the lands of perpetual winter.\n\n", "Media release": "[[Image:GoT Season 1 DVD promo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Season 1 Blu-ray set.]]\n[[Image:BestBuy S1 DVD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Season 1 Targaryen and Stark packaging exclusive to Best Buy in the United States.]]\n[[Image:Game of Thrones Limited Edition Season 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The limited edition set.]]\nSeason 1 of ''Game of Thrones'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on 5 March 2012, and in the USA a day later.
