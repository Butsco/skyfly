A little over two hundred years before the War of the Five Kings, during the reign of King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], the Night's Watch abandoned the Nightfort because they could no longer maintain it with their dwindling resources. Instead, they relocated their headquarters to Castle Black, where all subsequent Lords Commander were based.\n\n*The &quot;[[Night's King]]&quot; - one of the early Lords Commander who, according to legend, lived eight thousand years ago. The legends say that he was seduced by a female White Walker, declared himself king of the Night's Watch, and conducted human sacrifices at the Nightfort.

The Night's Watch is grievously under-strength by the beginning of the book series, having fallen from 10,000 when Aegon the Conqueror invaded to less than 1,000, divided into three garrisons at Castle Black (600 soldiers), the Shadow Tower (200 soldiers) and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea (less than 200 soldiers).\n\nOf these 1,000 men, almost 300 are killed in the [[Great Ranging]], due to the disastrous [[Battle of the Fist of the First Men]] and subsequent [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep]]. This further reduced the Night's Watches ranks to only 700 men, and perhaps worse, killed off most of their senior officers and best warriors, including Lord Commander Jeor Mormont himself. The expedition force consisted of one hundred men from the Shadow Tower and two hundred men from Castle Black.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Castle Black]], the Night's Watch takes a headcount: their entire manpower (including the garrisons at Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower) has been reduced to 589 brothers. Most of the losses are taken at the [[Battle of the Fist of the First Men]], and more at the following Battle of the Bridge of Skulls and the Battle of Castle Black.\n\nThe oath used in the show leaves out one line from the oath in the books.\n\n''Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am '''the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers,''' the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.''\n\nThe Night's Watch has no [[Heraldry|heraldic symbol]], to emphasize its sworn duty to be removed from petty politics of one lordly House or another, but to defend the lands of men as a whole. Thus, the Night's Watch uses solid black on its banner and shields, which symbolize the erasure of any allegiance to noble Houses. Even the &quot;uniform&quot; of the Night's Watch is to wear solid black clothing; members from wealthier families often buy all-black clothing before leaving for the Wall, while poor conscripts have their clothing simply dyed black when they reach the Wall (clothing which isn't always well-suited for cold weather). Solid black specifically denotes the rejection of heraldry, and is therefore strictly speaking not a &quot;symbol&quot; in and of itself, but the absence of a symbol.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]] and what lies [[Beyond the Wall|beyond]] and it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

Each order is led by its own officer, each appointed by the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch: the [[First Ranger]], [[First Builder]], and [[First Steward]].\n\n*[[Ranger]]s - the true warriors of the Night's Watch. While all black brothers are expected to have some basic arms training and to take up a sword in defense of the Wall itself, the Rangers are the ones who are sent on dangerous scouting expeditions beyond the Wall, to track wildlings movements. When the Watch was more numerous in past centuries they formed the core fighting group sent to destroy large wildling warbands who attempted to pass south of the Wall.\n*[[Builder]]s - who physically maintain the structures of the Night's Watch, and repair the Wall itself.\n*[[Steward (Night's Watch)|Stewards]] - who provide for the day-to-day needs of the Watch: gathering, cooking, and serving food, repairing clothes and equipment, tending to the horses and messenger-[[Ravens|ravens]], and gathering firewood. By far the largest of the three orders.\n\nEach castle of the Night's Watch also has a [[Maesters|maester]] assigned to it. These maesters take the oath of the Night's Watch and are considered full black brothers, but are not considered part of the three orders. Given that there were never more than nineteen castles along the Wall, there were never more than nineteen maesters in the Night's Watch at any one time. Since there are only three active castles on the Wall in modern times, there are now only three maesters in the Night's Watch at a time.\n\n===Leadership===\n\nThe leader of the Night's Watch is the [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]]. Each Lord Commander serves for life, and a new Lord Commander is democratically elected by other members of the Night's Watch in a [[Choosing]].\n\nIt is unknown if there is any formal procedure to depose a Lord Commander and elect a new one, in cases where the current Lord Commander violates his oaths or is deemed medically unfit to lead, etc.\n\n===Recruitment===\n\nRecruiters commonly known as &quot;[[Wandering Crows]]&quot; travel to the cities of southern Westeros to gather up new recruits to join the Night's Watch. In recent years, most of these tend to be criminals, murderers, rapers, and thieves taken from the dungeons of major cities and towns. A few also join because they are desperately poor and have no better options. Once and a great while a younger son or [[Bastardy|bastard]] son of a major noble House will decide to join the Night's Watch, but they can often afford to travel to the Night's Watch on their own initiative (such as Jon Snow and Waymar Royce).\n\nRecruiters are few in number, and they are not considered a separate order in the Night's Watch. Instead, they are drawn from trusted members of the three orders, often those who can no longer fight well due to injuries but who can still travel. \u00c2\u00a0\n\n===Military Strength===\n\nLate in the reign of King [[Robert Baratheon]], the Night's Watch had dwindled to under one thousand members - many of them old men or untrained boys. While there are nineteen castles along the Wall, the Watch only has enough men to continue to man three of them: their headquarters Castle Black in the middle, the Shadow Tower at the western end, and their port Eastwatch-by-the-Sea at the eastern end.\n\nThe Watch took severe losses in Jeor Mormont's disastrous expedition beyond the Wall, losing nearly 300 men. Combined with heavy losses during the [[Battle of Castle Black]], as well as losses from other wildling attacks, by the time that King [[Stannis Baratheon]] arrives at the Wall the entire organization consists of only around 600 members.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\u00c2\u00a0(spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Oath": "When joining the Night's Watch, all members must swear the following oath, either in a [[sept]] if they are of the [[Faith of the Seven]], or before a [[heart tree]] if they follow the [[Old Gods of the Forest]].\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;''Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.

They man a vast structure known as [[the Wall]], a 700 foot tall and 300 mile long barrier which separates the Seven Kingdoms from the lands to its north. It is formed mostly from ice. The Watch have built several castles along the southern edge of the Wall to house their men. They also control a region south of the Wall known as [[the Gift]], from which they obtain supplies and provisions. The region was donated to them by [[House Stark]], the [[King in the North|Kings in the North]], at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;viewers guide appendices&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Night's Watch viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/nightswatch/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, Night's Watch entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMembers of the Night's Watch swear an oath of duty that is binding for life and prohibits marriage, family, and land ownership. Recruits renounce all past allegiances and birthrights. Joining the Watch provides absolution for past crimes and immunity from further punishment. Brothers start with a clean slate and can rise within the ranks whatever their origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night's Watch viewers guide&quot; /&gt;\nThey describe one another as &quot;sworn brothers&quot; because of the oath.

Desertion is punishable by death. First Ranger [[Benjen Stark]] would often visit his family at [[Winterfell]] while representing the Night's Watch.\n\n[[File:Castle_Black.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Castle Black]] - largest of the three occupied castles.]]\n\nThe Watch was once highly regarded and their ranks were filled with volunteers from noble houses, as serving was a sign of selfless devotion to the protection of the realm.{{cite}} However, most recruits are now criminals avoiding punishment, nobles avoiding scandal, orphans and other social outcasts. Men known as wandering crows, such as [[Yoren]], travel around the Seven Kingdoms gathering recruits for the Watch, offering them escape on the Wall. For the highborn, the Wall is a convenient place to exile embarrassing or disgraced family members. [[Samwell Tarly]] was disowned by his own father and ordered to join the Watch on threat of death, while [[Tywin Lannister]] had plans to exile his own son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to the Wall so as to avoid executing him for allegedly murdering King [[Joffrey Baratheon]].\n\nBy the reign of King [[Robert Baratheon]], the institution has fallen into disrepute and is largely ignored by the [[Iron Throne|throne]]. It is severely undermanned; dwindling numbers have led to all but three of the Wall's nineteen castles being abandoned. The Night's Watch is now led from its stronghold at Castle Black.&lt;ref name=&quot;viewers guide appendices&quot; /&gt; The [[Shadow Tower]] and [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] are the only other castles that are still manned. Meanwhile, trouble is stirring [[beyond the Wall]]. A large wildling army under a new [[King Beyond the Wall]], [[Mance Rayder]], is advancing south, and there are rumors that the White Walkers, long since thought to be extinct, have returned. The leader of the Night's Watch when [[Jon Snow]] arrives at the Wall is Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]].\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\nIncreased wildling activity beyond the Wall leads the Watch to send out several patrols to investigate. Some do not return. A three man scouting party consisting of Ser [[Waymar Royce]], [[Gared]], and [[Will]] is one of those sent out, but only Will returns - then frantically tries to desert the watch by running south. He rambles that the legendary White Walkers killed his companions, but he is disbelieved as a madman and beheaded by Lord [[Eddard Stark]] for desertion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen [[Tyrion Lannister]], younger brother of Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], makes a visit to the Wall while traveling to [[Winterfell]], he is met at Castle Black by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and Maester Aemon. They implore him to bring news to the king that the Night's Watch is severely undermanned and undersupported: they are down to under a thousand members, and barely have the resources to feed and support the few men they still have. Mormont warns Tyrion about disturbing rumors coming from beyond the Wall, about missing scouting parties, and the one man who did survive an attack say it was the White Walkers finally returning, just before he was executed. Aemon warns that they have had a very long summer lasting for years, and that the coming winter may be also be long and bitter - and only the gods can help them if they do not do more to prepare for what's coming.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nJeor Mormont's [[Great Ranging]] travels far beyond the Wall, and sets up a base camp at the [[Fist of the First Men]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nThe Night's Watch engages in the first open conflict between men and White Walkers in eight millennia when their position is assaulted in the [[Battle of the Fist of the First Men]].
