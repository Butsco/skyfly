It is located roughly halfway along the length of [[the Wall]] on its southern side, at the northern end of the [[Kingsroad]]. It is a dark and chilling home to its garrison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/castle-black/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Castle Black entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCastle Black is one of only three manned castles left on [[the Wall]] along with [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] and [[The Shadow Tower]]. There are nineteen castles along the Wall, but as their numbers fell over the centuries the Night's Watch had to abandon sixteen of them. Castle Black is located between the unmanned castles of Queensgate and Oakensheild.\n\nCastle Black has a sept, but no [[Godswood]]. Those who are followers of the [[Old Gods of the Forest]] must travel a mile [[Beyond the Wall|north]] of the Wall and into the [[Haunted Forest]] to take their vows before a [[heart tree]].\n\n", "Gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nJon, Sam and Pyp.jpg|Training yard stairs, and wooden walkways.\nJon and Benjen.jpg|Top of the Wall.\nJon and Jeor.jpg|Lord Commander's room.\nCastle Black Great Hall.png|Castle Black common room.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Castle Black"}
