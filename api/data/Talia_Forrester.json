I'll do it.|Talia to Rodrik Forrester.|The Sword in the Darkness}}\n\n'''Talia Forrester''' is the youngest daughter of Lord [[Gregor Forrester]]. During Lady [[Elissa Forrester]]'s fourth pregnancy, she dreamed she would birth a daughter with a voice like a summer rain. But as destiny would have it, she gave birth to a boy. The infant, [[Ethan Forrester|Ethan]], wailed for hours \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; until Lady Forrester entered a second labor, this time birthing a girl. She named the girl Talia, after her own mother \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; and from then onwards Ethan rarely ever cried. Her dream came true, for there is no sound in [[Ironrath]] more poetic than that of Talia singing as her brother plays a lute.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nTalia was the fifth born child of Lady Elissa Forrester and Lord Gregor Forrester. She has five other siblings: Ethan, her twin brother counterpart, [[Rodrik Forrester|Rodrik]], [[Asher Forrester|Asher]], [[Mira Forrester|Mira]], and [[Ryon Forrester|Ryon]].\u00c2\u00a0\n\n===&quot;[[Iron From Ice]]&quot;===\nTalia's father is killed during the [[Red Wedding]] by Frey Soldiers at the Twins, a fatal clash that only [[Gared Tuttle]], squire to her father, survives. Upon arriving in Ironrath, Talia and her mother greet Gared, who brings the grisly news of the events of The Red Wedding and Lord Gregor's sword. Talia shows concern for Gared's own losses. Sometime later, Talia plays with Ryon and Ethan in the ironwood outside the fort, contemplating Ethan's new duties as the Lord of Ironrath. Depending on what choice the player makes, Talia will begin to show increasing concern for her twin brother's safety and morality. Ethan manages to save Talia from the grasps\u00c2\u00a0of [[Ramsay Snow]] after he arrives to negotiate over the ironwood for [[House Bolton]], but is killed as a result. Talia is deeply affected by her brother's untimely death.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n===&quot;[[The Lost Lords]]&quot;===\nTalia is first seen singing and practicing for the funeral of her brother and father while Rodrik sleeps. When Rodrik wakes up after, Talia tells Rodrik Ethan is dead and that she misses him. She then asks Rodrik about his leg and if he will be able to walk again. Rodrik then tries to but falls to the ground. The player can then choose to accept Talia's help or to try and walk on their own. Both eventually head outside where some of the Whitehall men make fun of Rodrik. During the funeral for Gregor and Ethan, Talia sings a passionate ballad concerning their deaths and how House Forrester will continue to fight on.\n\n===&quot;[[The Sword in the Darkness]]&quot;===\n''TBA''\n\n"}, "title": "Talia Forrester"}
