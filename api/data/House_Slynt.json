[[Harrenhal]] is a large and impressive (but also ill-omened) castle in the [[Riverlands]], on the lake known as [[Gods Eye]]. However, Harrenhal was held by [[House Whent]], a vassal house of the [[House Tully|Tullys]], so Slynt couldn't take possession of the castle until the current war between the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and [[House Stark|Starks]] is resolved.\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Slynt is founded as a reward for Janos Slynt's assistance in arresting Eddard Stark. Janos takes for his sigil a bloody spear, gold on a night-black field.\n\n[[Tywin Lannister]] ridicules both Slynt's ascension to lordship, and his choice of sigil when he hears of it, commenting that a &quot;bloody meat cleaver would be more appropriate&quot;, given the fact that Slynt himself was the lowborn son of a butcher. At Tywin's order, Tyrion dismisses Janos when he arrives in the capital, exiling him to the Night's Watch and stripping his family of Harrenhal - which he never actually set foot in. Tyrion felt Janos wasn't trustworthy enough to keep around the royal court, but he did allow Janos's children to keep their recently ennobled status. &quot;House Slynt&quot; therefore continued to nominally exist, but possessed no lands. Tyrion said that he would try to find lesser lands for Janos's sons to hold but it is unclear if he ever did. Otherwise, Janos's sons continue to appear as hangers-on at the royal court.\n\n===Members===\n* Lord Janos Slynt\n** Lord Morros Slynt, his eldest son, inherits his father's title after the latter is sent to the Wall.\n** Jothos Slynt, his second son Morros' heir.\n** Danos Slynt, his youngest son.\n** a daughter.\n\n", "Members": "* Lord [[Janos Slynt]], the head of the family and former Lord of [[Harrenhal]].\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\nLord [[Eddard Stark]] asks Janos Slynt, as Commander of the [[King's Landing]] [[City Watch]], to assist him in taking Joffrey Baratheon and [[Cersei Lannister|his mother]] into custody, and\u00c2\u00a0Slynt agrees.
