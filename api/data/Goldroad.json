It connects [[Casterly Rock]] and [[Lannisport]] in [[the Westerlands]] to [[King's Landing]] in [[the Crownlands]].\n\nTraveling from west to east, it passes [[Deep Den]] before ultimately exiting the southeast of [[the Westerlands]]. From there, it passes back and forth along the border between [[the Reach]] and [[the Riverlands]] (the road itself does not mark the border). First it runs through the extreme north of the Reach, then it crosses the border into the Riverlands at the point where the Reach/Riverlands borderline intersects with the [[Blackwater Rush|Blackwater]] River. After crossing into the Riverlands the road follows the north bank of the Blackwater all the way to King's Landing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/casterly-rock/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Casterly Rock entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs the Goldroad runs along the southern border of the Riverlands, it is not a practical route for any travelers or large armies attempting to move directly between the Riverlands and the Westerlands, as they would have to go very far out of their way to round about to the southern side of the Westerlands. Instead, the [[River Road]] is the only major highway between Casterly Rock and [[Riverrun]], as it runs through the only pass through the mountains along the northeast border of the Westerlands, guarded by the fortress of [[Golden Tooth]].\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Goldroad is in the same location.\n\n"}, "title": "Goldroad"}
