The only two unaccounted bannermen from the books are Ser Harys and Ser Flement Brax. As the latter is a younger character, second son of Lord Andros Brax, it is safe to assume the unidentified bannerman sitting next to Ser Kevan is meant to stand in for Harys Swyft\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Gallery": "&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nLannisterCouncil.jpg|Ser Harys in a Lannister council\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Biography": "Ser Harys Sywft is the Knight of Cornfield and the head of House Swyft, a knightly house of [[the Westerlands]].
