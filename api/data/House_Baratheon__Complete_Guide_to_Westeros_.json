It is narrated by [[Mark Addy]] as [[King]] [[Robert Baratheon]].\n\n", "Synopsis": "[[Robert Baratheon]] recalls the victories that led to [[House Baratheon]] cementing themselves as one of the greatest houses in [[Westeros]].\n\n", "Summary": "&quot;Ours is the Fury&quot;, are the words of the black stag of [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]]. Robert I calls it a battle cry that echoed throughout the [[Westeros|land]] in rebellion, when he seized the [[Iron Throne]] from the Mad King, [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]], ending a [[House Targaryen|dynasty]] nearly three hundred years old.\n\nHouse Baratheon was born in the [[Wars of Conquest]], when [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Dragon]] invaded Westeros. Aegon sent his commander, [[Orys Baratheon]] to take [[Storm's End]]. [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]], the last of the [[Storm King]]s, foolishly left the safety of his stronghold and met the Baratheon warlord in [[Fall of Storm's End|open battle]]. Argilac was soundly defeated, and Orys took his lands, holdings and [[Argalia Baratheon|daughter]]. Orys was said to be a half-brother of Aegon's, so Robert muses that if that were to be true a little of the &quot;blood of the dragon&quot; mingled with that of the [[House Durrandon|stag]] in those days.\n\nThe seat of House Baratheon is Storm's End, a legendary keep raised in the [[Age of Heroes]]. Storm's End overlooks [[Shipbreaker Bay]], where legend tells that [[Durran]], the first Storm King, raised the keep with the aid of [[Bran the Builder]] of [[House Stark]], thus forging a centuries-long connection between [[the Stormlands]] and [[the North]].\n\nAfter Aegon's conquest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], Baratheons remained loyal enough to the crown while Targaryen kings came and went. Robert reminds that, however, loyalty has its limits. When Aerys' vile son and heir, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] [[Lyanna Stark]], Robert's betrothed and beloved, it was time to act.\n\nBaratheon, [[Ned Stark|Stark]], [[Jon Arryn]] and the [[House Tully|Tullys]] raised their banners and united in rebellion against Rhaegar and his father, the Mad King. They were victorious and took the [[Iron Throne]]. Robert muses that the bit of dragon blood in his veins came in well as it made him a distant relation to the Targaryen dynasty through his distant ancestor, Orys. The truth, however, is that Robert took power. He boasts that it is him who sits on the Iron Throne and that it is him who rules the [[Seven Kingdoms]] from the [[Red Keep]].\n\n"}, "title": "House Baratheon (Complete Guide to Westeros)"}
