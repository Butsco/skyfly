Though many men, including Lord [[Eon Hunter]] and a [[Knight of House Lynderly]], offer to fight as Lysa's champion, she asks Ser Vardis to represent [[House Arryn]]. At first he says that fighting Tyrion would be unfair, but Vardis accepts when Tyrion asks that he be represented by a champion. The [[sellsword]] Bronn offers to be Tyrion's champion. Vardis fights dressed in full metal armor and carrying a large and heavy wooden shield. His speed and dexterity were easily outmatched by Bronn, who wore only a leather armored shirt. During the course of the fight, Bronn throws things into Ser Vardis' path and even trips him, while quickly dodging and weaving to avoid Vardis' attacks. Ultimately Bronn tires out the more heavily armored knight, severely injuring him with a quick slash and disarming him.\n\n[[File:Bronn defeats Vardis.jpg|thumb|Vardis falls from the Moon Door.]]\nBronn waits for Lysa Arryn to call for mercy, but she does not respond. So he stabs Vardis in the neck and pushes him through the &quot;[[Moon Door]]&quot; in the center of the throne room sending him down a thousand-foot drop. Lysa snaps angrily to Bronn that he didn't fight with honor. The sellsword agrees, before pointing to the Moon Door and noting that Ser Vardis did.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Vardis Egen"}
