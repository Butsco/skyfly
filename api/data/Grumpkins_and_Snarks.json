In the present day, White Walkers are most often spoken of in nursery stories and fictional tales, alongside the likes of ghosts or &quot;grumpkins and snarks&quot;.\n\n", "In the Books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels Grumpkins and Snarks are creatures of legend almost always mentioned in this pairing, usually mentioned when people are dismissing the White Walkers as nothing but the stuff of legends and children's tales, like ghosts, mermaids, White Walkers, or [[Giants]].\n\nWhat little information has been given is that Grumpkins are supposed to be small of stature, and grant people three wishes. Sort of like the older &quot;faerie&quot; stories of Gaelic myth, however, Grumpkins can actually be very dangerous - it is pointed out that stories about Grumpkins are meant to ''frighten'' children. At one point it is also noted that Grumpkins sometimes steal and replace children, like the Changeling of real-life myth.\n\n"}, "title": "Grumpkins and Snarks"}
