House Reyne was obliterated after they [[Reyne Rebellion|rebelled against]] their liege lord, [[Tytos Lannister]], who was perceived as weak by his own vassals. To restore Lannister dominance, Tytos's son, Tywin, marched against the upstart Lord Reyne. By the end of the rebellion, Castamere had been put to the torch and all members of House Reyne executed. The title is thus a play on words, as the &quot;rains&quot; fall over the empty halls of the &quot;Reynes&quot; who have been killed to the last man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lannister featurette&quot;&gt;The [[Complete Guide to Westeros]]: House Lannister&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe lyrics heavily reference the fact that the sigil of House Reyne was ''also'' a lion, but a red one instead of the golden lion used as the sigil of [[House Lannister]]. The rebellion of the Reynes against the Lannisters was thus seen as a clash of lions.\n\nIn the decades since young Tywin reasserted House Lannister's dominance by crushing the Reynes, ''The Rains of Castemere'' went on to become very popular with soldiers of [[the Westerlands]], becoming an &quot;anthem&quot; of sorts for House Lannister. This extends to the point that even Western soldiers sometimes refer to it simply as, &quot;the Lannister song&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Blackwater]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Lyrics": ":::''And who are you, the proud lord said, ''\n:::''that I must bow so low?

It is dedicated to [[Tywin Lannister]] in particular and [[House Lannister]] in general.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, ''The Rains of Castamere'' was composed after [[Tywin Lannister]]'s victory over their rebellious bannermen: [[House Reyne]] of [[Castamere]] and the ancient House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall. Lord [[Tytos Lannister]], Tywin's father, had been a kind but weak ruler. He loaned money to lords who never bothered to repay him and his vassals openly ignored his orders and mocked him in court. When Lord Reyne (known as the Red Lion of Castamere)\u00c2\u00a0and Lady Ellyn Tarbeck rose in rebellion, Tywin took it upon himself to deal with the rebellion and wiped out both of the upstart lords, their families and households and put their seats of power to the torch.\n\nSome years later after the extinction of House Reyne\u00c2\u00a0when Lord Farman of Faircastle\u00c2\u00a0grew truculent, Lord Tywin sent an envoy bearing a lute instead of a letter to play \u00e2&euro;&oelig;The Rains of Castamere\u00e2&euro;? in Farman's hall, and the latter\u00c2\u00a0gave no further trouble.\n\nIn the novels,\u00c2\u00a0''The Rains of\u00c2\u00a0Castamere''\u00c2\u00a0and its story (as above) are first mentioned in Chapter 19 of\u00c2\u00a0Volume 3,\u00c2\u00a0[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords A Storm of Swords], and the full lyrics''\u00c2\u00a0''are first provided in Chapter 39 of the same volume; the TV show uses that lyric without alteration.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "[[Image:Soundtrack Season 2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The song appears on the Season 2 soundtrack album.]]\nThe version used in the TV series' soundtrack was recorded by the American indie rock band [[The National]], and appears on the ''[[Game of Thrones Season 2 Soundtrack]]'', as well as over the closing credits for the episode &quot;[[Blackwater (episode)|Blackwater]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot;/&gt; Originally producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B.
