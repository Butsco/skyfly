Petyr, Tommard, Edric...|Queen Selyse Baratheon|Kissed by Fire}}\n'''Edric Baratheon''' is one of the stillborn sons of [[Stannis Baratheon]] by his wife [[Selyse Florent]]. His mother keeps his corpse in a glass jar on display in her chamber along with his also stillborn brothers, [[Tommard Baratheon|Tommard]], and [[Petyr Baratheon|Petyr]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' book series, there is no mention Selyse Baratheon having any stillborn sons.\n\nHe shares a name with King Robert's one acknowledged [[bastard]] from the novels: Edric Storm. For the TV series, Edric Storm's storyline in the third novel is merged with [[Gendry]]'s.\n\nTo be clear: Selyse's stillborn son &quot;Edric Baratheon&quot; ''is not'' the TV series's &quot;version&quot; of Edric Storm. Selyse isn't stated to have any stillborn sons in the novels, thus the writers had to make up names for all three - and they tried to remain internally consistent by choosing other common names used for characters from the Stormlands in the books.\n\n", "Gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nSelyse Fetus Jar Concept Art.jpg|Concept art of the fetus jars.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "Staff writer [[Bryan Cogman]] came up with the idea of the stillborn fetuses being preserved in jars. Cogman said in an interview, &quot;''It was a proud day for me as a writer when I walked on set and saw those magnificently nasty prop dead babies floating in those jars.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/episodes/3/25-kissed-by-fire/interview/bryan-cogman.html HBO: Game of Thrones: Interview With Bryan Cogman]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season Three Appearances|5=yes}}\n\n"}, "title": "Edric Baratheon"}
