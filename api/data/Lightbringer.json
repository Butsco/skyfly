At the behest of [[Melisandre]], he pulls it out of the fire created by burning statues of [[the Seven]].\n\nAccording to prophecy, Lightbringer would be pulled from fire by the Lord's Chosen, [[the Prince That Was Promised]], champion of the [[Lord of Light]].\n\n==\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;In the books==\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lightbringer is a sword of legend, forged and wielded by\u00c2\u00a0[[Azor Ahai]], chosen by the Lord of Light to fight the darkness. The\u00c2\u00a0sword was said to glow and radiate heat, burning whoever touches it. \n\nAs in the TV series, Melisandre enchants Stannis's sword and dubs it Lightbringer, as she believes\u00c2\u00a0him to be Azor Ahai reborn. However, Melisandre is apparently unable to get the sword to radiate heat, and it only gives off bright light.\n\nThus there is a discrepancy between the &quot;Lightbringer&quot; of legend, and Stannis's sword &quot;Lightbringer&quot;, named after the original.\n\n"}, "title": "Lightbringer"}
