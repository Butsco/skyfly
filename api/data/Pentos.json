It is a large, rich city.\n\nPentos is located at roughly the mid-latitude of the Free Cities, between [[Braavos]] in the north and [[Lys]] in the south. It is due east of [[King's Landing]], across the Narrow Sea. It is surrounded by fertile coastal plains known as the [[Flatlands]].\n\nPeople of Pentos are known as '''Pentoshi'''. The city's economy is based mostly on trade and commerce of products such as cheese. As a result, Pentoshi traders like [[Illyrio Mopatis]] are often referred to derogatively as &quot;cheese-mongers&quot;. They have a brisk trade with the [[Seven Kingdoms]] across the Narrow Sea. They use their wealth to pay tribute to the [[Dothraki]] to avoid being sacked by the nomadic people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/pentos/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Pentos entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPentos is nominally ruled by a [[Prince of Pentos|Prince]] chosen by the city's Magisters from among the Pentoshi noble families. The Prince supposedly holds the powers of trade, justice, and war, and on every new year he must deflower the [[Maid of the Field]] and the [[Maid of the Sea]] to bring good fortune to the city. However, should a crop fail or a war be lost, the Magisters slit the Prince's throat and choose another.&lt;ref&gt;Complete Guide to Westeros&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe city is the home of [[Magister]] [[Illyrio Mopatis]]. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and [[Viserys Targaryen]] temporarily reside in Pentos for about one year prior to Daenerys' marriage to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/pentos/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Pentos entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Notable citizens": "[[File:Illyrio Mopatis.jpg|thumb|Illyrio Mopatis, a Pentoshi merchant-lord.]]\n* [[Illyrio Mopatis]], a wealthy Magister of Pentos.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Pentos was the northernmost of the large [[Valyria]]n colony-cities when the Doom destroyed the empire four centuries ago. Pentos and the other Free Cities became independent over the course of the many-sided war known as the Century of Blood. Pentos is a large seaport consisting of squat brick buildings and a number of large palaces and holdings, both within the walls and outside on the plains known as the [[Flatlands]]. Pentos has fallen under the influence of [[Braavos]], the largest and most powerful of the Free Cities, and to maintain good relations with Braavos Pentos has outlawed slavery. Pentos's location makes it especially vulnerable to raids from the [[Dothraki]]. As such the Pentoshi merchants are prone to feasting and gifting the passing Dothraki warlords with lavish parties and gifts to appease them into not destroying their holdings.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Pentos&quot; is pronounced &quot;PEN-tos&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Pen-TOES&quot;, etc.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\n[[File:Narrow_Sea.jpg|thumb|left|The exiled Targaryens look west across the Narrow Sea from Pentos.]]\nDaenerys and Viserys are guests of Illyrio Mopatis in his manse just outside the city of Pentos.
