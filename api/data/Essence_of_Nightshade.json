A single drop added to a cup of wine will calm frayed nerves, and three drops will put a person into a deep, dreamless sleep. Ten drops, even diluted into a cup of wine, are fatal.\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF|Sweetsleep}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n*{{AWOIAF|Nightshade}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels there is no specific medicine called &quot;Essence of Nightshade&quot;: in the TV series, it appears to stand in for a variety of analgesic or anesthetic medicines which were present in the novels.\n\nA medicine called &quot;Sweetsleep&quot; has slightly similar properties: it is used as an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic at low doses, though it can be dangerous at high dosages.\n\n&quot;Nightshade&quot; has also been mentioned as a poison. The real life deadly nightshade plant, also known as belladonna, has similar properties. Unlike &quot;Essence of Nightshade&quot;, this &quot;Nightshade&quot; poison has no medical properties.\n\nWhen Tywin sent Joffrey to bed after he insulted him in the Small Council, in the books he told Pycelle to give him a substance known as &quot;dreamwine&quot;, which is apparently just a very strong kind of wine, administered for medical purposes. It is flavored with exotic spices from [[Qarth]].\n\n", "History": "===Season 2===\n[[Cersei Lannister]] acquires a bottle from [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] when readying for the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

Willing himself to behave calmly, Tywin coldly says that the king is &quot;tired&quot; and orders him sent to his chambers to rest - and that Grand Maester  Pycelle should administer him some Essence of Nightshade to make sure he sleeps.
