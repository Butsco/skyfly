This relationship is what allowed Robert to claim the [[Iron Throne]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]].\n\nSteffon Baratheon appears to have been an effective lord. He was once defeated by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] during a [[tournament]]. He was sent by King Aerys II to the [[Free Cities]] to find a bride for Prince Rhaegar, but he found no suitable matches. He did find a talented fool, however, one whom he believed would teach even Stannis to laugh. However, Lord Steffon's ship, the ''Windproud'', sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End. His body and that of his wife, Lady Cassana of House Estermont, was never found. The fool, Patchface, did wash ashore, but the trauma of the event robbed him of his wits.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nSteffon Baratheon was the [[Lord of Storm's End]] and head of [[House Baratheon]], one of the [[Great Houses]] of [[Westeros]].
