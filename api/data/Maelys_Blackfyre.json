He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it begins.\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Blackfyre family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Maelys Blackfyre was the last male descendant [[Daemon Blackfyre]]. He had a huge upper body and a second head sprouting from his neck. This was said to be the head of his twin whom he had absorbed in the womb, earning him the nickname &quot;Maelys the Monstrous&quot;, as he had become a [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]], though not by choice.\n\nMaelys was named Captain-General of the [[Golden Company]] after killing his cousin Daemon when they fought for the position, becoming a kinslayer for the second time, although this time by choice. During the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], Maelys was one of the Band of Nine, a group of merchants, sellswords, and pirates who joined forces to carve kingdoms out for themselves. After conquering the [[Disputed Lands]], [[Tyrosh]] and the [[Stepstones]], Maelys convinced the other members of the band to attack [[Westeros]] and aid him in retaking what he claimed was his birthright. However, [[House Targaryen|the Targaryens]] acted swiftly and sent their own force out to the Stepstones to meet him. There, Maelys was slain by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] in single combat on the Stepstones, ending the Blackfyre pretensions to the [[Iron Throne]].\n\nThe exact line of descent from Daemon I to Maelys is unclear. Daemon had seven sons and several daughters. Based on chronology, he was apparently Daemon I's grandson, but it isn't known from which of his children.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\n[[File:War Of the Ninepenny Kings.png|thumb|275px|Barristan Selmy kills Maelys Blackfyre, at the end of the War of the Ninepenny Kings.]]\nMaelys Blackfyre was the last of the Blackfyre Pretenders to the [[Iron Throne]]. Like previous members of [[House Blackfyre]], he proclaimed himself the rightful king as a descendant of [[Daemon Blackfyre]], [[bastard]] son of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], while the main Targaryen line descended from Aegon IV's lawful son King [[Daeron II Targaryen]]. Maelys rallied an army of mercenaries in the [[Free Cities]] and began a conquest of the [[Stepstones]] as a prelude to invading Westeros itself.  The Targaryens attacked the Stepstones before he could launch the invasion, leading to the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. This conflict ended when Maelys was killed in the Stepstones by the young Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], extinguishing Daemon Blackfyre's line and ending further threat of Blackfyre pretenders.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Death of Kings]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Maelys Blackfyre"}
