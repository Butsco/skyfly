But I was a woman before I understood them.|[[Catelyn Tully]]|Robert's Rebellion (Histories &amp; Lore)}}\n'''House Tully''' is one of the [[Great Houses]] of [[Westeros]]. Its most senior member carries the title of [[Lord of Riverrun]] and [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]]. The current head is Lord [[Edmure Tully]], son of the late [[Hoster Tully]]. The Tully sigil is a silver trout on a red and blue background. Their motto is '''&quot;Family, Duty, Honor.&quot;'''\n\nAt the onset of the [[War of the Five Kings]], [[House Tully]] came under attack by [[House Lannister]] and lent its support for [[House Stark]] when they came to their aid in the liberation of the Riverlands. House Tully has since been [[Attainting|formally stripped]] of lands and titles for rebellion against the [[Iron Throne]], with Lord Edmure a [[hostage|captive]] of [[House Frey]] following the [[Red Wedding]].\u00c2\u00a0\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tully is an old house which has held the castle at [[Riverrun]] for some centuries, but did not rise to greatness until King Aegon I's invasion. Aegon drove the ironborn out of the Riverlands and appointed Lord Edmyn Tully as the overlord of the area in thanks for his support during the Conquest. The Tullys joined the [[House Stark|Starks]], [[House Baratheon|Baratheons]] and [[House Arryn|Arryns]] in rising against the Mad King, providing numerous troops for [[Robert Baratheon]]'s armies.\n\nThe Tully banner is different in the books than in the series. In the TV series, it is striped horizontally, with one large red section and one large blue section, separated by white stripes. In the novels it has five ''vertical'' stripes of equal width; two muddy-red stripes separate three blue stripes (and there are no white stripes).\n\nThe following sworn houses have yet to appear in the series:\n* House Piper of [[Pinkmaiden]]\n* House Ryger of Willow Wood\n* House Vance of Wayfarer's Rest\n* House Vance of Atranta\n* House Paege\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Gallery": "&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nHouse Tully.jpg|The sigil of House Tully from the Maester's Path promotional campaign\nTully icon.png|HBO viewer's guide icon for House Tully.\nTully sigil.jpg|House Tully's sigil in black and white from the HBO viewer's guide.\nTully Shield.jpg|A shield emblazoned with the sigil of House Tully from the HBO viewer's guide.\nTully-small.png|Small icon of House Tully from the HBO viewers guide.\nHouse Tully tourney.jpg|The banner of House Tully at the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]] in &quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things|Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]&quot;.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nHouse Tully is one of the [[Great Houses]] of [[Westeros]]. Their lands are to the west of the continent. Their seat is [[Riverrun]], a castle at the confluence of the Red Fork of [[the Trident]] with the [[Tumblestone]]. They rule over the [[Riverlands]] from the castle and the head of the house is the [[Lord of Riverrun]].\n\nHouse Tully rose to prominence during the [[Wars of Conquest]]. Lord [[Edmyn Tully]] rebelled against the [[King of the Isles and the Riverlands]], [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]], to support the invading [[House Targaryen]]. Edmyn's fellow Riverlords followed his lead. When [[Aegon Targaryen]] established his rule from the [[Iron Throne]] he rewarded Edmyn, elevating the Tullys to [[Lords Paramount of the Riverlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;House Tully viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/tully/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Tully entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIts current head is Lord Edmure Tully.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoster Tully viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/tully/hoster-tully/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Tully - Hoster Tully entry]&lt;/ref&gt; His sisters, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]], married Lords [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Jon Arryn]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]], forming a powerful alliance of major houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lysa Arryn viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/arryn/lysa-arryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Arryn - Lysa Arryn entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "House Tully"}
