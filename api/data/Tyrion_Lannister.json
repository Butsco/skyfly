He is played by starring cast member [[Peter Dinklage]] and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming (episode)|series premiere]]. Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] and younger brother of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister]]. A [[dwarf]], he uses his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces.\n\nTyrion is falsely accused of the [[Catspaw assassin|attempted assassination]] of [[Bran Stark]] and taken captive by [[Catelyn Stark]]. Though he is eventually released after a [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]], his arrest triggers [[War of the Five Kings|conflict]] between the Lannisters and the [[House Stark|Starks]], which escalates into full war after the death of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and the arrest and execution of [[Eddard Stark]]. Tyrion is shortly after sent by his father to [[King's Landing]] to be acting [[Hand of the King]] to his newly crowned nephew [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], with instructions to rein him in. With him he takes a prostitute named [[Shae]] whom he makes his mistress and comes to love, and [[Bronn]], a fearsome [[sellsword]] who serves as his bodyguard and enforcer.\n\nUnder difficult conditions, Tyrion holds the city together, strengthens and organizes the city's defenses, and makes an alliance with [[House Martell]]. He plays a vital role in the Crown's victory over [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s forces during the [[Battle of Blackwater]], and is wounded. Afterwards, Tyrion loses his position as Hand to his father.\u00c2\u00a0He remains an important player in the court, however, and is appointed [[Master of Coin]] and unwillingly married to\u00c2\u00a0[[Sansa Stark]], considered the heiress to\u00c2\u00a0[[North|the North]]\u00c2\u00a0after the scattering of the Starks. When Joffrey\u00c2\u00a0is poisoned at his [[Purple Wedding|wedding feast]],\u00c2\u00a0Cersei\u00c2\u00a0accuses Tyrion of his murder\u00c2\u00a0and Tyrion is\u00c2\u00a0put on [[Second Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial]]. Realizing that the trial is a farce,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0demands a trial by combat. However, his champion, Prince [[Oberyn]], is brutally murdered by the Crown's champion [[Gregor Clegane]], sentencing him to death. Before the sentence can be carried out, Jaime frees him. A vengeful Tyrion [[Assassination at the Tower of the Hand|kills]] Shae and his father, then flees with [[Varys]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tyrion is in his mid-twenties when the events of the series begin, whereas in the show his age is not mentioned. However, the age gap between him and his siblings is smaller: in the books Tyrion was born when Cersei was 10 while in the show she was 4.\n\nAs well as being a dwarf, Tyrion is misshapen and often described as ugly and having eyes of [[wikipedia:heterochromia|two different colors]], one green and one black. He is described as having a huge disproportionate head and an pronounced ungainly waddle when he walks. His hair is lank and very pale, but when he lets his beard grow in it comes in as a mixture of blonde and black hairs. In the TV series, actor Peter Dinklage insisted on not having a beard, because he felt that bearded dwarves are a fantasy stereotype.\n\nTysha was reported to be the daughter of a crofter rather than a wheelwright and the marriage took place when he was only 13 years old. He bought them a little cottage where they lived as man and wife for their two week marriage, before his father had it annulled. Tywin not only had 50 guards rape her, but then ordered Tyrion to have sex with her as well, giving her a gold piece as a Lannister is worth more.\n\nAt the Battle of the Green Fork, Tyrion is not knocked out by his own men. In fact he leads with distinction, holding the line under great adversity. Later when he tells his father that the plan to kill him by putting him in the vanguard (under the command of Ser Gregor Clegne) failed, Tyrion learns that his father had put him there hoping that an inexperienced Tyrion with undisciplined hill tribesmen would break and run to be pursued into a trap by the Stark forces. Tyrion holding the line had ruined the plan. It is a combination of this along with his reading of the situation they face in the war, and the fact that Jaime Lannister may not be retrievable, that makes Tywin decide to make use of Tyrion as acting Hand. Tyrion realizes that Tywin is preparing for the worst, that the Starks might well kill Jaime as revenge for Eddard's murder, so he is finally giving Tyrion real power.\n\nWhen Tyrion relieves Janos Slynt of command of the Gold cloaks it is a man named Ser Jacelyn Bywater or &quot;Ironhand&quot; who becomes their new commander, not Bronn. It is Varys, not Tyrion, who comes up with the suggestion to send Joffrey some prostitutes to soften his temper, but the results are not shown. Tyrion does not send Petyr Baelish to Catelyn Stark at Renly's camp with Lord Eddard's bones and an offer for the release of Jaime Lannister (though Baelish is sent to treat with the Tyrells after Renly's death). The bones are sent with Cleos Frey (replaced by [[Alton Lannister]] in the series) to Riverrun along with unacceptable peace terms and a force of 100 Lannister soldiers that hide four men Tyrion has sent to break Ser Jaime out, an escape attempt that fails. Shae is not brought to the Tower of the Hand, instead she is put in a manse that Tyrion can approach by using a tunnel from under a brothel. The most important of the defenses for the city that Tyrion builds is a huge chain that stretches across the whole of Blackwater Rush, to be raised after Stannis' fleet enters to trap them inside with the wildfire.\n\nIn the book's version of the Battle of Blackwater, Tyrion has almost his entire nose cut off by Ser Mandon Moore's sword swipe; the TV series only included the deep scar across his face (which as also present in the books). As Peter Dinklage explained, &quot;I know, for fans of the books, that Tyrion loses his nose in the battle. But it would be next to impossible and very expensive to do that on television, and I would be wearing a green sock [on my nose, to digitally remove it with greenscreen], I think, for the next however many years, which I don't know how that would be on set. But yeah, the digital artist would have a lot of work on their hands. So I think we came up with a really good solution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wicnet.tumblr.com/post/46675084287/peter-dinklage-explains-why-tyrion-gets-to-keep Peter Dinklage Season 3 premiere Red Carpet interview]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the official blooper reel for Season 4, when &quot;action&quot; is shouted and a stage hand closes the [[Wikipedia:Clapperboard|clapperboard]] right in front of Dinklage's face, he started jokingly pretending that board was held too close and cut his nose off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-7Fs9HJvs0 Season 4 bloopers from SDCC], about 17 seconds into the clip.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Tyrion Lannister&quot; is pronounced &quot;TEER-ee-un LAN-iss-ter&quot;.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|Let me give you some advice, bastard.

[[The Westerlands]] are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the [[Great Houses]] of the realm. He is the younger brother of [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Cersei Lannister]]. His mother [[Joanna Lannister]] died giving birth to him. His father and sister blame him for the death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyrion viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/jbaratheon/tyrion-lannister/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of King's Landing - Tyrion Lannister entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHe is a [[dwarf]], causing him problems and persecution. His size has led him to\u00c2\u00a0being referred to derisively by various names, such as &quot;the Imp&quot; and &quot;The Halfman&quot;. This is mitigated by his intellect and his family's wealth and power. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a commoner, he'd have simply been left out in the woods to die. However, Tyrion was born into a powerful noble House, and was therefore spared. Even though his father doesn't think much of him, he has had the benefits of being raised with wealth and education, and is expected to lead his life as a credit to the Lannister name.&lt;ref name=&quot;E2&quot;/&gt; He is committed to the good of both his House and, since Cersei married King Robert Baratheon, his family's continued hold on the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyrion viewers guide&quot;/&gt;\n\nWhen Tyrion was 16, he met a wheelwright's daughter named [[Tysha]] on the road, apparently the victim of an attempted rape. While his brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] ran off the attackers, Tyrion helped Tysha recover from the ordeal, and they became lovers. They found a drunken, wandering [[septon]] willing to\u00c2\u00a0marry them and briefly, they lived as husband and wife. That is, until Lord Tywin learned what had happened. Jaime confessed that he organized the incident to make his brother happy, and Tysha was actually a prostitute. As a lesson, Tywin gave Tysha to his guards, paying her a silver coin for each man and forcing Tyrion to watch. By the end, there were so many silver coins that they were running out of her hands onto the ground. Tyrion has reciprocated Tywin's hatred ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;E9&quot;/&gt;\n\nHis two siblings have had positions of respect and responsibility since their teens. When Tyrion turned sixteen (the age of manhood), Tywin Lannister put Tyrion in charge of the drains and cisterns at Casterly Rock. Tyrion brags that the sewage never flowed smoother to the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;E18&quot;/&gt;\n\nTyrion spends a lot of time at court in [[King's Landing]] to avoid his father. He gets on well with Jaime and his niece Myrcella and nephew Tommen, but has a colder relationship with Cersei and his sadistic nephew Joffrey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cersei viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/jbaratheon/cersei-baratheon/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of King's Landing - Cersei Baratheon entry]&lt;/ref&gt; He has a fondness for prostitutes and drink, but is also intelligent, cunning, and educated. He also is a kind man who would protect the innocent claiming that he loves broken things.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\nTyrion accompanies King [[Robert Baratheon]]'s party to [[Winterfell]], but after weeks on the road he leaves the party and rides ahead to seek the pleasures of the winter town's brothels, where he makes the acquaintance of [[Ros]].&lt;ref name=&quot;E1&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He gives the prostitute a Lannister lion necklace to thank her for their time together.&lt;ref name=&quot;E5&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime convinces him to join the family for dinner. Tyrion dawdles outside the feast hall, reluctant to make nice with the [[House Stark|Starks]] and his own family, and as a result meets [[Jon Snow]], Lord [[Eddard Stark]]'s\u00c2\u00a0[[bastard]]\u00c2\u00a0son. He realizes that Jon is something of a kindred spirit: &quot;All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E1&quot;/&gt;\n\nWhen Tyrion's nephew, Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]], refuses to pay his respects to Lord and Lady Stark after [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s fall, Tyrion slaps him three times until he acquiesces. He then breakfasts with his family, where he reveals that he wants to go and visit [[the Wall]] - to see it and piss off of it, he says to the laughter of Tommen and Myrcella, before returning to [[King's Landing]]. He takes an interest in Bran's fall and how it happened, noting carefully his brother and sister's reactions to the news that Bran is likely to live.&lt;ref name=&quot;E2&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn the road to [[Castle Black]], Tyrion tells Jon that he likes to read as it keeps his wits sharp, just as his brother's whetstone keeps his sword sharp. Reaching the Wall, even Tyrion is temporarily rendered speechless by the size and scale of the structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;E2&quot;/&gt; During his stay, Tyrion watches the new recruits train. He realizes that Jon Snow, due to his advantages of being trained by a castle master-at-arms at Winterfell, is acting superior to his fellow recruits, embarrassing them by beating them easily in training. After Tyrion points this out Jon begins helping the others train, earning their respect and friendship. [[Aemon|Maester Aemon]] and Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] ask him to use his influence at court to get more men and resources sent to the [[Night's Watch]]. Tyrion is sympathetic, but doesn't believe that there is anything more dangerous than [[wildlings]] beyond [[the Wall]]. However, [[Benjen Stark]]'s account of life beyond the Wall gives him pause. Tyrion befriends [[Yoren]], a recruiter for the Watch, and they agree to travel back to the capital together.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion and Bran 1x04.png|thumb|300px|Tyrion speaks with Bran.]]\n\nPausing at Winterfell on the return trip home, Tyrion gives Bran plans for a special saddle so that he can ride even in his crippled state. He taunts [[Theon Greyjoy]] about his family's defeat during their [[Greyjoy Rebellion|uprising]] before leaving. Stopping at the [[Crossroads Inn]] on the way home, he is surprised to meet [[Catelyn Stark]], and even more so when she denounces him as an attempted murderer and has him arrested by her father's bannermen to face the King's justice. She was told by Petyr Baelish that the knife used in the assassination attempt on Bran was one Tyrion won from Petyr by betting on a jousting tournament.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Catelyn takes Tyrion, protesting his innocence, to [[the Eyrie]]. A sellsword from the inn, [[Bronn]], accompanies them and notes Tyrion's wealth and a promise he will handsomely reward any man who aids him. Along the way they are attacked by some of the hill tribes and Tyrion kills his first man, bashing in the skull of an attacking tribesman with a shield. Tyrion warns Catelyn that her sister, [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]], has become irrational with grief and will try to kill him. She is skeptical, but at the Eyrie Tyrion's warning proves accurate. Lysa hysterically accuses him not only of the attempted murder of Bran, but also of conspiring in that of her husband [[Jon Arryn]], former Hand of the King who died suddenly which Lysa tells Catelyn was one of the Lannisters' doing. Tyrion is thrown into one of the Eyrie's &quot;sky-cells&quot;, dungeons which simply open on their fourth side to the open air with a drop of many thousands of feet to the valley below.&lt;ref name=&quot;E5&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion and Mord.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Tyrion in the sky cells of the Eyrie.]]\n\nTyrion bargains with his jailor, [[Mord]], to get an audience with Lady Arryn. He &quot;confesses&quot; to being a whoremonger and dwarf, but truthfully insists that he is not guilty of the crime of murdering Jon Arryn or trying to murder Bran. He demands a [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] as is his right and his wish is granted when the sellsword Bronn agrees to stand as his champion. Bronn defeats and kills Lady Arryn's champion, Ser [[Vardis Egen]]. By the laws of Westeros this means that Tyrion has proven his innocence in the eyes of the gods, and he is released from the Eyrie to face the perilous journey back through the tribesman-infested hills. Bronn accompanies him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrion establishes some ground rules with Bronn, saying he will pay more money than anyone else who attempts to bribe him to betray Tyrion. They are then surrounded by men of the [[hill tribes]], led by [[Shagga]]. Tyrion uses his quick wits and words to win the allegiance of the tribes, offering to equip them for battle and help them conquer the Vale of Arryn in return for their help. Shagga agrees, though he notes that if Tyrion tries to renege on his promise he will cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.\n\nTywin Lannister's forces have been attacking the Riverlands ever since Catelyn Tully Stark arrested Tyrion. It's not that he cares so much about Tyrion, he explains to Jaime, but because even though Tyrion is the least of them he is still a Lannister, and if they allow one of their own to be taken forcefully, they risk losing the respect of the other Houses. The hillmen deliver Tyrion to his father's army, where he learns that [[Robb Stark]] is leading an army to war. Tyrion warns his father that Robb should not be underestimated. Tywin agrees to honor Tyrion's alliance with the hill tribes. When Shagga says they will only fight if Tyrion is with them on the field, Tywin agrees, to Tyrion's dismay.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion and Bronn 1x09.png|thumb|Tyrion drinks with Bronn before battle.]]\n\nTyrion is commanded by his father to lead the hill tribes into battle from the front. Feeling that his father means to kill him, Tyrion retires to his tent, where he finds that Bronn has found a prostitute for him, a girl named [[Shae]]. Tyrion attempts to learn more about Shae, but finds his questions deflected. Instead he tells her about his own past with [[Tysha]], a wheelwright's daughter. They married and spent several happy weeks together until Tywin learned of the matter. Tywin had Jaime tell Tyrion the truth, that Tysha was a prostitute that Jaime had paid to make his brother happy for a while. Tywin then gave her a piece of silver for every one of his guards she had sex with while Tyrion was forced to watch. Since then Tyrion has never attempted to take a wife or lover, only whores he can pay and send on their way.&lt;ref name=&quot;E9&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion and Tywin 1x10.png|thumb|left|300px|Tyrion discusses the future with his father.]]\n\nTyrion leads the tribes into battle, but is knocked out by one of his own warriors' mis-swung hammers just as the engagement begins. Recovering, Tyrion learns from his father that Robb deceived them, delaying their army with a feinting force so the main Stark host can fall on and defeat Jaime's army in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;E9&quot;/&gt; With Robb's forces now allied to those of the Riverlands and both [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]] claiming the [[Iron Throne]], the odds have swung against the Lannisters. Tywin risks being caught between three armies, so he retreats to [[Harrenhal]]. Tyrion makes shrewd observations about the ominous turn the current situation has taken now that Joffrey has killed [[Eddard Stark]]. Grudgingly impressed, Tywin orders Tyrion to report to King's Landing and act as the [[Hand of the King]] to try to keep Joffrey in line. Tywin forbids him to take &quot;that whore&quot; with him, but Tyrion defies him and asks Shae to come to King's Landing with him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nTyrion arrives in King's Landing, accompanied by [[Bronn]] and members of the [[hill tribes]]. He assumes the role of acting [[Hand of the King]] to [[Joffrey Baratheon]], who isn't happy to see him, unlike [[Myrcella]] and [[Tommen]]. After taking his seat at the [[small council]], he clashes with his sister, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]], over her failure to stop the execution of his predecessor as hand, [[Eddard Stark]]. He also criticizes her for allowing [[Arya Stark]] to escape, as the girl and her father could have been useful to bargain for the return of Jaime, and now they only have one Stark hostage instead of three. He installs [[Shae]] in the [[Tower of the Hand]], in defiance of [[Tywin Lannister|his father]]'s orders.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion warns [[Varys]] not to underestimate him after the Spider discovers Shae's presence and lets Tyrion know that he is aware of her. During a small council session, Tyrion finds himself the only sympathetic ear to a request by the [[Night's Watch]] for aid from the throne. He also criticizes Cersei's lack of talent for diplomacy when she rejects peace terms from [[Robb Stark]] brought by their cousin Ser [[Alton Lannister]]. Tyrion invites Lord [[Janos Slynt]] for dinner and gets him to confess his part in the recent [[Massacre in King's Landing|massacre]] of [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]]'s bastards as well as his part in the betrayal of Eddard. After openly noting Slynt's lack of honor, Tyrion has Lord Janos exiled to [[the Wall]] as punishment, and installs Bronn as commander of the [[City Watch]] in his place.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:ShaeAndTyrion.jpg|thumb|300px|Tyrion returns to King's Landing with [[Shae]].]]\n\nTyrion arranges for Shae to serve as a handmaiden to [[Sansa Stark]] when she demands more freedom. He tests the loyalty of the remaining small council members by feeding them varying plans to form marriage alliances involving Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]]. He is confronted by Cersei about sending Myrcella to Dorne in a betrothal to the youngest son of [[House Martell]]. Tyrion has Pycelle thrown into the black cells for revealing the information given only to him. Varys congratulates him for the ploy to lure out the Queen's informant. Tyrion is also confronted by an angry [[Petyr Baelish]] for having been unwittingly involved in the ruse; nevertheless, Tyrion recruits Littlefinger in a plan to convince [[Catelyn Stark]] to release Jaime, offering him [[Harrenhal]] and the title of [[Lord Paramount of the Riverlands]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion is shocked and furious to find Joffrey orchestrating the public beating of Sansa for her brother [[Robb Stark]]'s victory in the [[Battle of Oxcross]]. He orders a halt to the proceedings, and warns Joffrey to consider his actions more carefully, lest he wants to suffer the same fate as the [[Mad King]]. He then escorts Sansa out of the throne room. Bronn suggests that Joffrey would benefit from sexual release. Tyrion arranges for two whores for his nephew but Joffrey forces one to beat the other as a message to Tyrion.&lt;ref name=&quot;E14&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Lancel Lannister]] visits Tyrion to demand the release of Pycelle on Cersei's behalf. Tyrion notes the lateness of the hour and traps Lancel into admitting his sexual relationship with Cersei. Tyrion uses the information to blackmail Lancel into acting as his informant.&lt;ref name=&quot;E14&quot;/&gt; Tyrion reports news of King [[Renly Baratheon]]'s death to Cersei. She is pleased but Tyrion predicts [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s imminent attack having assumed control of Renly's men. He tries to discuss plans for their defense but she insists on keeping them secret. He learns that she is reliant of the [[Alchemists' Guild]] from Lancel. He visits Wisdom [[Hallyne]] and learns that the guild have stockpiled thousands of jars of [[Wildfire]] to use as catapult ammunition. [[Bronn]] sees this strategy as potentially disastrous because of the volatile nature of wildfire. Tyrion orders Hallyne to answer to him instead of Cersei. He passes a street protest that blames him for the ills of the city, as the people believe him to be manipulating Joffrey.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion and the court assemble at the shore of the [[Blackwater Bay]] for the departure of Princess Myrcella. Cersei remains angry about Tyrion's arrangements for her daughter. She threatens to one day deprive him of someone he loves. As they return to the [[Red Keep]] through the city they are confronted by angry crowds of starving Smallfolk. Joffrey is hit by thrown excrement and triggers a [[Riot of King's Landing|riot]] by demanding that his guards kill everyone in the crowd. Tyrion is horrified when the [[High Septon (Before the riot of King's Landing)|High Septon]] is torn apart by the famished crowd. He marshals his guards to lead him to safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOnce he is safely separated from the riot Tyrion confronts Joffrey for triggering the riot and the war that preceded it, calling him a vicious idiot. He slaps Joffrey when his nephew refuses to listen to the criticism. Tyrion orders Meryn Trant to retrieve the missing Sansa but Meryn will not follow his orders. He is relieved when [[Sandor Clegane]] brings her to safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\nCersei confesses that she feels that Joffrey's viciousness might be the price she pays for her sin of incest with Jaime. Tyrion does not know how to comfort his sister in this rare moment of vulnerability but reminds her that both Myrcella and Tommen are kind and gentle. Word that Stannis' fleet is days away reinforces the need to control Joffrey.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrion turns to books for insight into siege defense tactics but Bronn warns that the grim realities of a siege cannot be understood from reading. Tyrion affirms the loyalty of Varys and is enigmatic about his plans for the battle but believes Stannis will attack at the [[Mud Gate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;E18&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nJoffrey is keen to fight in defense of the city. Cersei is furious and suspects Tyrion of trying to kill her son. She mistakenly identifies [[Ros]] as his lover because of the Lannister pendant Tyrion gave her and seizes the opportunity to deliver on the threat she made when Myrcella left. Cersei has the prostitute kidnapped as insurance against Tyrion placing Joffrey in harm's way. She reveals her ploy over dinner. Tyrion is relieved that Shae is unhurt, vows to free Ros and when the prostitute is taken away, he promises Cersei that he will exact revenge on her. He rushes back to his lover's side and confesses the depth of his feeling for her while warning that they must be doubly careful.&lt;ref name=&quot;E18&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion at war.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyrion at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].]]\n\nTyrion leads the defense of the city during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. He commands the defenders at the Mud Gate. He destroys a large portion of the attacking fleet by luring them into a trap; a ship filled with Wildfire and allowed to leak its cargo into the bay. He signals Bronn to detonate the Wildfire using a flaming arrow. Stannis continues with the assault, landing his troops further out in the bay to avoid the devastation of the explosion. Tyrion's initial attempts to repel the attackers are unsuccessful and Cersei has Joffrey withdrawn to the Red Keep, with the King leaving Ser [[Mandon Moore]] and Ser [[Boros Blount]] of the Kingsguard to fight in his name. Tyrion is faced with increasing dissent from his troops but rallies them with a rousing speech. He personally leads a sortie through the tunnels under the city, destroying Stannis' siege equipment. He is trapped outside the walls by a group of reinforcements and then betrayed by Ser Mandon. Mandon slashes Tyrion across the face but Podrick kills him before he can finish Tyrion off. As Tyrion collapses into unconsciousness a host of Lannister-Tyrell reinforcements led by [[Loras Tyrell|a man]] wearing Renly's armor arrives to claim the victory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Blackwater]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Shae and Tyrion Scar 2x10.png|thumb|left|250px|Tyrion shows Shae his scarred face]]\n\nTyrion awakens to find [[Pycelle]] looming over him. The reinstated Grand Maester gloatingly informs Tyrion that he has been relieved as Acting Hand of the King and moved to new chambers. Tyrion rejects pain relief, fearing that his enemy will poison him. He calls for Podrick to summon his allies, Varys and Bronn. Varys visits Tyrion and regretfully tells him that although his leadership was key to saving the city he will not be recognized by King Joffrey. He also reports that Bronn has been relieved of his command and his tribesmen have taken their plunder and gone home. Varys offers a small consolation; he has brought Shae to see Tyrion. Varys leaves them alone and Shae removes Tyrion's bandages to reveal a scar marring his whole face. Tyrion is self-pitying; she angrily asserts her love for him and begs him to flee to [[Pentos]] with her. He says that standing up to the bad people in his life, out-talking and out-thinking them, is something that he is good at and enjoys. He chooses to stay in King's Landing and she agrees to remain with him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nAfter speaking with his sister,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0requests his father give him\u00c2\u00a0[[Casterly Rock]], as Jaime gave up all rights of inheritance when he joined the Kingsguard.

As\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0leaves, he says if he catches another whore in his bed he will hang her.\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion is surprised to understand that Bronn has been knighted and styles himself as &quot;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tords&quot;/&gt;\n\nLater, Tyrion informs Shae that she cannot keep visiting his bed chambers as Tywin has now banned him from ever being with her again.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:We need Details.jpg|thumb|Tyrion and Ser Bronn learn from Podrick.]]\n\nIn a Small Council meeting, Tyrion is made [[Master of Coin]] by his father after it is announced the departure of Lord Baelish to the [[Eyrie]]. Following the meeting, Tyrion, Podrick Payne and Ser Bronn visit the brothel where Tyrion provides the young Pod with a late gift, thanking him for his heroism on the battlefield at Blackwater. Leaving Podrick with his gift, the young later returns to Tyrion and Ser Bronn while they're drinking and discussing King's Landing's endless debt to the Bank of [[Braavos]], and they are intrigued to learn how he managed to leave the brothel without having to pay the girls.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEscorted by Varys to a dark room, Tyrion is finally told the story of how the eunuch was travelling through the [[Free Cities]] with a party of actors. It is revealed that he was castrated by a male sorcerer who spoke to the air and 'something' answered him. Varys then pries open the box in the room and reveals the [[Sorcerer]] who had done this terrible deed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Cersei-and-Tyrion.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tyrion &amp; Cersei ponder their forced marriages.]]\n\nLady [[Olenna Tyrell]] explains to Tyrion that [[House Tyrell]] will support the cost of the wedding between Joffrey and Margaery. Following this, Lord Tywin summons both Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Cersei to his chambers\u00c2\u00a0to inform them of his plans to wed them off, Cersei to Loras\u00c2\u00a0Tyrell and\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0to Sansa\u00c2\u00a0Stark, who Tywin explains will be heir to Winterfell after he defeats Robb Stark, thus giving the Lannisters a future foothold in the North.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei and Tyrion are evidently reluctant to consider these marriages, but as they do, Tyrion brings up the question of who employed Ser [[Mandon Moore]] to kill Tyrion. Cersei, of course, denies her involvement, but Tyrion is still suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Climb]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn result, Tyrion hesitantly marries Sansa. At the night of their wedding, Tyrion gets drunk and threatens Joffrey with castration after the latter commands him to carry out the bedding ceremony with Sansa. Tywin calms Joffrey and Tyrion takes Sansa to his bedchamber, where he tells her that his lord father has commanded him to consumate the marriage. As Sansa begins to disrobe, Tyrion refuses, insisting that he won't bed her until she wants him to, then he passes out drunk.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion and Sansa wedding 2 3x08.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyrion &amp; Sansa at their wedding night.]]\n\nAfter his marriage, Tyrion starts bonding with Sansa and lightly enhances his relationship with her. Later, Tywin calls a meeting of the small council where Joffrey\u00c2\u00a0happily informs him that Robb and Catelyn Stark have both been murdered at the [[Red Wedding]] by [[Walder Frey]]. He orders Grand Maester Pycelle to thank Frey and command him to send Robb Stark's head, which he will serve to Sansa at his wedding. Although, Tyrion threatens him yet again before Pycelle can send any messages to [[The Twins]]. After the end of the\u00c2\u00a0meeting, Tywin and Tyrion discuss the details of what consequences the Red Wedding might have on the war. Tywin reminds him that he still has to impregnate Sansa Stark, but Tyrion assures him that he can't and won't do it even forcefully. Tywin lectures Tyrion on protecting family legacy and that the house that puts family first will always prevail over the family the fulfills the wishes of its sons and daughters first. Tyrion accuses Tywin and protests that he has never done something for the benefit of the family that wasn't in his interest. Tywin tells him that when he was born, he wanted to leave him in the sea and let the waves take him away, and that he instead he let him live and raised him because he is a Lannister. Afterwards, he\u00c2\u00a0returns to Sansa, who is in tears having heard of her brother and mother's tragedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mhysa&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater, Cersei visits Tyrion and informs him that she won't be marrying Ser Loras. She also advises him to give Sansa children, to which Tyrion responds by asking her how happy is she with her children. Cersei admits that if it wasn't for her children, she would've killed herself, even for Joffrey. She ponders how happy he used to be in his infant years and how much he brought such joy in her life at that time, and that neither Joffrey nor anyone else can take that away from her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mhysa&quot;/&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nTyrion\u00c2\u00a0is sent to welcome Prince [[Doran Martell]] to King's Landing. As he, Podrick, and Bronn are expecting the Dornishman, they spot [[House Martell|Martell]] bannermen coming their way. Tyrion greets them, but they inform him that Prince Doran's declining health prevents him from leaving [[Sunspear]], and therefore he has sent his brother Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] to attend King Joffrey's wedding in his stead. They also explain that Oberyn went ahead and entered the city before dawn. Tyrion quickly puts together that he may be at one of Littlefinger's brothels. When Tyrion arrives, he finds Prince Oberyn stabbing a man's hand for singing ''[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains Of Castamere]]''. He is introduced to Oberyn's [[paramour]], [[Ellaria Sand]], and asks the Dornishman to talk in private. He asks him why he came to the capital and Oberyn tells him that he was invited to the royal wedding. Tyrion knows he's lying and asks for the honest truth. Oberyn remembers how [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] wed his sister [[Elia Martell|Elia]], and how his involvement with [[Lyanna Stark|another woman]] caused [[Robert's Rebellion]]. He tells Tyrion that the war ended with his father [[Sack of King's Landing|sacking the city]] while &quot;The Mountain&quot; (Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]) brutally murdered Elia's children, then raped and murdered her. He orders Tyrion to tell his father that he's here, and warns him that the Lannisters are not the only ones who pay their debts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tords&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Oberyn-tirion.jpg|thumb|250px|Oberyn warns Tyrion.]]\n\nAfterwards, he visits a deeply depressed Sansa and tries to comfort her by telling her that her brother and mother were good people. In tears, she tells him the grueling details of how they died. Tyrion advises her to stay strong, as that is what her mother would want. Sansa leaves to go to the [[godswood]] and she tells Tyrion that she doesn't pray anymore, and instead goes because nobody is talking to her there. Distraught, he returns to his bedchamber, where Shae is waiting for him. She tries to pleasure him but Tyrion refuses. Shae questions him if he's really in love with Sansa. Tyrion says that he doesn't and this time, Shae asks him if he wants her out of the city. After getting no answer, she storms out of his bedchamber, and it is revealed that one of Cersei's spies heard the whole conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tords&quot;/&gt;\n\nIn the days following, Tyrion, along with other noblemen and women present in King's Landing, attend the breakfast on the morning of Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell's [[Purple Wedding|wedding]]. He meets [[Varys]] before arriving, who informs him of Cersei's spy and Cersei's consequent knowledge of Shae's presence, and warns him that Tywin will know shortly. Varys also warns him that he will not protect Tyrion or Shae against the former's father and sister out of regard for his own safety. At the breakfast, Tyrion observes Cersei's indication of Shae to her father as &quot;the whore I told you about&quot;. Tywin subsequently requests that she be brought to the [[Tower of the Hand]] before the wedding. Tyrion then presents the groom a gift of a tome detailing the reigns of [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron, the Young Dragon]]; [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]]; [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]] and [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron the Good]]. This is met with surprising approval and gratitude from the King until he is presented with a [[Valyrian steel]] [[Widow's Wail|sword]] by his grandfather and proceeds to demonstrate the blade's sharpness by destroying the book with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lion&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the breakfast, Tyrion meets with Shae in his quarters and shows uncharacteristic and confusing coldness towards her despite her gestures of affection. He terminates their &quot;friendship&quot; and informs her that she is to leave and go to live in [[Pentos]], telling her that she must do so in order for him to uphold her marital vows to Sansa. She deduces that he is afraid of his sister and father and expresses her desire to fight them alongside him. As she draws closer, Tyrion yells at her, calling her a whore, and states her unfitness to bear his children, in contrast to Sansa's. Bronn arrives to escort the sobbing Shae to the docks, resulting in her slapping him and storming off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lion&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[File:joffrey+tyrion wine-spill.jpg|thumb|250px|Joffrey insults Tyrion at the former's wedding feast.]]\n\nAt the wedding feast, Joffrey organizes some entertainment: five dwarfs mockingly re-enacting the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Tyrion, disgusted, instructs Podrick to pay each dwarf 20 gold dragons after the show. At the conclusion of the show, Joffrey suggests Tyrion fight the former's dwarf counterpart. Tyrion politely declines and sarcastically voices awe at Joffrey's skill and bravery at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and his desire to see them again. Insulted at the disrespectful undertone, Joffrey pours his wine over Tyrion's head in an immature show of superiority. He then instructs Tyrion to act as his cup-bearer, before kicking the goblet under a table, forcing Tyrion to handle it several times. He finally orders him to kneel and Tyrion, obviously possessing no intention to do so, is saved by the arrival of the pigeon pie. He attempts to flee the scene with Sansa but is spotted by Joffrey who commands him to remain and continue his duties as his cup-bearer. Tyrion hands the king his goblet, who begins to choke after drinking from it. In his final moments, Joffrey points to Tyrion, apparently accusing him, as he checks the goblet for poison and he is seized and arrested by members of the [[Kingsguard]] on Cersei's orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lion&quot;/&gt;\n\nAfter Tyrion has been incarcerated, he gets a visit from Podrick who smuggles in some food and writing materials to help him get through imprisoned life. He informs Tyrion of Sansa's disappearance.\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion is sure that Sansa had nothing to do with the murder. Just as Pod leaves he turns around and tells Tyrion about a man whom he didn't know offering him a knighthood if he testified against him. Tyrion knew that it wasn't a suggestion and soon they'll threaten him with something worse and tells Pod he must leave King's Landing and says farewell.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt\u00c2\u00a0Bronn's intervention, Jaime comes to see Tyrion. Jaime tries to comfort Tyrion and says that he suffered much worse with the North. Jaime asks Tyrion if he did it and Tyrion says he would never kill his brother's son and Tyrion asks Jaime to set him free but Jaime says he can't because of treason and says the trial will get to the truth. Tyrion knows that the trial doesn't matter, Cersei won't rest until Tyrion is dead. Jaime then goes on to him believing that Sansa had something to do with the murder but Tyrion is again adamant that Sansa is innocent.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion's trial begins with the newly-crowned\u00c2\u00a0[[King]]\u00c2\u00a0[[Tommen]]\u00c2\u00a0recusing himself. Instead, a group of three judges are appointed to oversee the trial: Tywin Lannister as presiding judge, Lord\u00c2\u00a0[[Mace Tyrell]]\u00c2\u00a0of the\u00c2\u00a0[[Reach]], and Prince Oberyn. Cersei has several witnesses testify against Tyrion, such as\u00c2\u00a0[[Meryn Trant]],\u00c2\u00a0[[Grand Maester]]\u00c2\u00a0[[Pycelle]], and\u00c2\u00a0[[Varys]]. They all give strong (yet circumstantial) evidence of Tyrion's guilt. He seems particularly hurt by Varys's betrayal, so much that he asks the spymaster whether he remembered what he had told him after the Battle of the Blackwater (that Tyrion had saved the city and that Varys knew it even if history wouldn't). Varys sadly tells Tyrion that he never forgets anything. After a one hour recess, Jaime comes to Tyrion and tells him that, when the verdict of guilty is pronounced, he must ask for mercy. Secretly, Jaime had made a deal with Tywin: in exchange for sparing Tyrion, Jaime will renounce his vows and return to Casterly Rock as Tywin's heir, while Tyrion will be sent to live out his days on [[The Wall]] with the [[Night's Watch]]. Tyrion points out that their father wanted this outcome all along. However, Cersei calls in her last witness:\u00c2\u00a0[[Shae]]. A hurt Tyrion can do little as Shae reveals his sexual\u00c2\u00a0pleasures in front of the court and his supposed desire to bed Sansa Stark, which she agreed to let him do if he killed the King for her. Tyrion's anger at the betrayal leads him to lash out: he angrily states that\u00c2\u00a0''he\u00c2\u00a0''had saved\u00c2\u00a0[[King's Landing]]\u00c2\u00a0from Stannis and that when he saw how all turned on him for killing a king that they all hated, he wished that he had let Stannis kill them all.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodLaws&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTywin attempts to\u00c2\u00a0silence Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0but his son turns on Cersei, declaring that he was innocent of killing Joffrey but that he wished he had, adding with gleeful venom that he derived more relief from watching her &quot;vicious bastard&quot; of a son die than he could have gotten from a thousand whores. He then turns on Tywin and calls the trial a farce and that it is really a repetition of the trial he had been on since he was born: for the crime of being a dwarf. Not wanting to submit to the &quot;justice&quot; that was being served on him, Tyrion demanded a\u00c2\u00a0[[trial by combat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GodLaws&quot;/&gt;\u00c2\u00a0[[File:Tyrion-bronn.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bronn refuses to be Tyrion's champion in trial by combat.]]\n\nIn his cell,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion and\u00c2\u00a0[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]\u00c2\u00a0discuss Tyrion's fate and the irony of Lord\u00c2\u00a0[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]\u00c2\u00a0striking down both his heirs if Jaime were to die being Tyrion's champion; Jaime declines to be Tyrion's champion as he cannot fight well enough with his left hand. Tyrion asks Jaime to bring him\u00c2\u00a0[[Bronn]]. Bronn arrives in the clothes of a lord, with news that he is to marry [[Lollys Stokeworth]], a noble's daughter, in a match arranged by\u00c2\u00a0[[Cersei]]. He will not fight\u00c2\u00a0[[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]]\u00c2\u00a0(whom Cersei has chosen for her champion), believing Clegane to be too dangerous for him to face, and bids farewell to Tyrion. They share a final handshake and part on good terms. Later, Tyrion is approached by\u00c2\u00a0[[Oberyn Martell]], who tells Tyrion of their first encounter: As children, Oberyn and his sister\u00c2\u00a0[[Elia Martell|Elia]] were told stories of the &quot;monster&quot; that had been born to Tywin Lannister. During a childhood visit to\u00c2\u00a0[[Casterly Rock]], Cersei showed Tyrion, with great ceremony, to Oberyn and Elia. Oberyn tells Tyrion that, to his disappointment, he saw no monster, just a baby. Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion killed her mother, and then cruelly assaulted\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion until Jaime stopped her. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he seeks justice for the death of his sister, and Tyrion replies that he will &quot;find none here&quot;. Oberyn counters that he is in the perfect place; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister's murder are close at hand. Intending to start his revenge with Gregor Clegane, Oberyn offers his service as Tyrion's champion in the coming trial by combat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mockingbird]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn the day of the trial by combat, Jaime visits Tyrion in his cell. They discuss their dead cousin [[Orson Lannister]] and his habit to smash beetles with rocks for no reason. Tyrion says he used to watch Orson for long periods of time and think about the reason behind his actions, but he hasn't come to any conclusion why all those countless beetles had to be killed. When Jaime says he doesn't know either, bells start tolling and he wishes Tyrion good luck. Tyrion is taken to watch the duel of Oberyn and the Mountain bound in shackles and before the fight starts, he advises Oberyn against drinking wine, but he doesn't pay a lot of attention to him. As the Red Viper starts winning, he exchanges a few hopeful looks with his brother and feels happy when Oberyn pins Ser Gregor to the ground with his spear, but his hopes are quickly shattered in the moment when the Mountain knocks Oberyn down and smashes his head in, thus deciding about Tyrion's fate. As Tyrion is\u00c2\u00a0struck with horror, Tywin states that the gods have made their will known and Tyrion is sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion is surprised when Jaime comes to his cell in the night and leads him\u00c2\u00a0through a secret passageway within the castle. He tells Tyrion that he will meet with [[Varys]], who has arranged for him to escape to the [[Free Cities]]. The brothers warmly embrace, believing it will be the last time they see each other. Jaime leaves him with a familial kiss on the cheek. Instead of proceeding directly to his liaison,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion first\u00c2\u00a0enters the chambers of their father. He finds a naked woman\u00c2\u00a0in his father's bed, and is shocked to discover that it is [[Shae]], moaning Tywin's name and calling for her &quot;lion,&quot; the name she had previously reserved for Tyrion. When Shae spots him, she grabs a paring knife and tries to stab him. She fails to do so but slaps him and scratches at his face. They struggle, and Tyrion eventually strangles her with Tywin's gold chain she is wearing.\u00c2\u00a0The act is done both in self defense and in jealous rage, and Tyrion is immediately distraught once he fully realizes what he has done. After apologizing to Shae's corpse, he takes Joffrey's crossbow and confronts his father while in his privy chamber. He forces his father to admit to his many wrongdoings against him.\u00c2\u00a0Tywin tries to placate Tyrion, but when he refers to Shae as a &quot;whore&quot; once too often, Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0kills him with two arrows to the chest. He proceeds to the chamber of Lord Varys, who stows him away within a crate upon a ship, and decides to accompany him at the last moment.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Children]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 5]]===\n\n", "Personality": "Tyrion recognized from an early age that his mind was his greatest weapon, due to being born a member of House Lannister\u00c2\u00a0with the expectation of\u00c2\u00a0upholding his family's noble name yet lacking the physical attributes possessed by his older siblings. Thus, he has committed himself to possessing a sharp intellect in order to help make up for his dwarfism, and he\u00c2\u00a0is frequently able to use his superior intellect to get the better of those who initially look down upon him or weasel his way out of tight situations, though he is not above resorting to using his family name and enormous fortune to bolster his position. He has also shown himself to possess a keen mind for strategy, as is evidenced in his research into defending against sieges and successfully conducting the defense of King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0prides himself on\u00c2\u00a0his ability to read people as easily as he does books, and he has on many occasions easily gotten the better of not just\u00c2\u00a0Joffrey and Cersei but also experienced players such as Littlefinger\u00c2\u00a0and Pycelle.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nDespite his harsh treatment at the hands of others over the years,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion has managed to develop a thick skin, able to brush off others' japes about his short stature (except when coming from his father). His advice Jon Snow about how to handle his own bastard status reflect how Tyrion has approached life: take your impediment in stride and wear it like armor, and then it cannot be used to hurt you. Being born a dwarf and subject to ridicule for most of his life,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0has admittedly developed a soft spot for his fellow outcasts and has shown them kindness, such as having a saddle designed for the crippled Bran Stark allowing him to ride. Being physically weak, Tyrion is also upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly insulted when [[Janos Slynt]] carried out an order to kill a defenseless baby girl, [[Barra]] (because she was one of Robert's bastards), and as punishment had him exiled to [[the Wall]]. Tyrion is also genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. He also seemed to have a level of honor and dignity that his family seemed to lack; events such as the Red Wedding disgusted him, and he considered them to be crimes. However, Tyrion did admit that cheating was necessary for war.\n\nTyrion, however, is not without faults. He tends to overindulge in food, drink, and sex in part to self-medicate for the terrible treatment he's suffered most of his life. Tyrion can also act vicious if he feels he's been wronged (like confining Grand Maester Pycelle to the Black Cells for betraying him or, in his darkest hour, killing Shae for testifying against him during his trial and having an affair with his father). Because his father and sister\u00c2\u00a0treated him like a social leper, Tyrion craves love and acceptance and is genuinely hurt when this is denied him by others.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nHe has complex relationships with other members of his family, most of whom resent him and only thinly veil their contempt for his existence. His older sister\u00c2\u00a0Cersei\u00c2\u00a0blames him for causing the death of their mother and has (as revealed during a conversation with\u00c2\u00a0Oberyn) hated\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0since his birth. His father,\u00c2\u00a0Tywin, shares\u00c2\u00a0Cersei's resentment for\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0due to the death of his wife while birthing him.\n\nOnly his older brother Jaime maintains a good relationship with\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion, admiring him for both his intellect and inability to let his diminished stature drag him down, and he has frequently attempted to come to\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion's\u00c2\u00a0defense when his other family members attempt to treat him maliciously. Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0harbors a mutual admiration for Jaime, even naming him as his champion when he demanded a trial by combat while being held prisoner at the\u00c2\u00a0Eyrie.\n\n"}, "title": "Tyrion Lannister"}
