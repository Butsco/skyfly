They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds.|[[Old Nan]]|Lord Snow}}\n\nThe '''White Walkers''' are a mythological race mentioned in ancient legends and stories from the time of the [[First Men]] and the [[Children of the Forest]]. Eight thousand years before [[Robert's Rebellion]], a winter known as [[the Long Night]] lasted a generation. In the darkness and cold of the Long Night, the White Walkers descended upon [[Westeros]] from the farthest north, the polar regions of the [[Lands of Always Winter]]. None knew why they came, but they killed all in their path, reanimating the dead as [[wights]] to kill the living at their command. Eventually the peoples of Westeros rallied and in a conflict known as the [[War for the Dawn]], they managed to defeat the White Walkers and drive them back into the uttermost north, with [[the Wall]] raised to bar their return.\n\nIn the present day, most believe they never existed and are just myths, spoken of in the same breath as ghosts, goblins, [[grumpkins]], or [[snarks]]. Even the few who believe they did once exist think they went extinct thousands of years ago. Certainly, none were seen for thousands of years after the Long Night.\n\n[[File:WhiteWalkersAwake.jpg|thumb|300px|The White Walkers have risen again]]\n\nJust before the outbreak of the [[War of the Five Kings]], however, disturbing reports began to reach the [[Night's Watch]] from the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] who live beyond the Wall that the White Walkers had returned. Having enjoyed a decade-long summer,\u00c2\u00a0Westeros seemed due for an equally long winter, and the White Walkers seem to be spreading with it. With the Seven Kingdoms embroiled in a petty civil war, the dwindling and under-supported Night's Watch realize that they are all that guards the realms of men against the return of these legendary demons of ice and death.\n\n", "Weaknesses": "[[File:White_walker_shatters_S3E8.jpg|thumb|A White Walker falling apart after being stabbed by Dragonglass.]]The only known weakness that the White Walkers have shown thus far is the ability to be killed instantly when struck with\u00c2\u00a0weapons made of\u00c2\u00a0[[dragonglass]]. Upon being stabbed by dragonglass, a White Walker's body will begin to freeze into ice from the point at which it is was stabbed, causing the Walker great pain. Finally, it will begin to fall apart, as its now icy body shatters until there is nothing left but powder.\n\n", " Appearances ": "&lt;p style=&quot;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;font-style:inherit;font-weight:inherit;margin-top:0.4em;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.5em;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;vertical-align:baseline;&quot;&gt;{{Season One Appearances|1=yes|10=}}{{Template:Season Two Appearances||yes||||||||yes}}{{Template:Season Three Appearances|yes|||||||yes|||}}{{Template:Season Four Appearances||||yes}}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "\n[[File:White Walker.jpg|thumb|The original White Walker design, barely glimpsed in &quot;[[Winter is Coming]]&quot;.]]The appearance of the White Walkers in the TV series isn't quite the same as in the books. They weren't fully revealed until the Season 2 finale, only quick shots mostly in the shadows in the premiere episode of Season 1. Freeze-frame shots of this display an early working-model design for the White Walkers, but given that it only flashed on-screen for a fraction of a second, this may never have been intended as their final appearance. This early design was almost skeletal, without noses. This original version really appeared too briefly to be seen without taking screenshots, but as this was the only glimpse of the White Walkers in the first season, fansites (and wikis) heavily circulated these screenshots, somewhat obscuring the fact that the White Walkers' &quot;official&quot; design hadn't been firmly established yet.\n\nAccording to [[Pixomondo]], the TV series's special effects studio, there was indeed a complete redesign of the White Walkers between the barely glimpsed early concepts in Season 1, and the fully revealed version introduced in the Season 2 finale: &quot;The producers and creatives were not happy with the White Walker costumes from season one; they wanted to redesign the look and it took a bit longer than expected.&quot; Only one full version of the redesigned White Walker costume was made by the Season 2 finale, thus the large shot of multiple White Walkers in the shot is just one stunt man doubled up many times. CGI enhancements were used to give the effect that wisps of cold air are emanating from the White Walkers' bodies, as well as to make their abdomens much more gaunt than human physiology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcocreate.com/1681718/collaboration-isnt-always-pretty-behind-the-emmy-winning-vfx-for-game-of-thrones?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+fastcocreate/feed+%28Co.Create%29#1 Fastcocreate.com] &quot;Collaboration Isn\u00e2&euro;&trade;t Always Pretty\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;Behind The Emmy-Winning VFX For \u00e2&euro;&oelig;Game Of Thrones\u00e2&euro;?&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe final version introduced at the end of Season 2 is closer to how they appear in the books. Some differences remain, in that White Walkers are said to wear much more armor in the books, made out of a strange reflective metal that almost acts like camouflage. Further, the White Walkers in the books are described as &quot;gaunt&quot; but they don't seem to have quite so much of a mummified appearance. They are actually said to have an otherworldly, icy beauty to them.\n\nAuthor [[George R.R. Martin]], when discussing with comic-book artist Tommy Patterson what the White Walkers were supposed to look like in the comic-book adaptation of the story he was drawing, said that: &quot;They are strange, beautiful...think, oh...the ''[[Wikipedia:Sidhe|Sidhe]]'' made of ice, something like that...a different sort of life...inhuman, elegant, dangerous.&quot; Martin also confirmed that the White Walkers are not &quot;dead&quot;, just an inhuman kind of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Others#Characteristics AWOIAF article on The Others]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sidhe'' are a kind of otherworldly fairy creature from Irish mythology, said to inhabit burial mounds, etc., not unlike the Barrow-wights of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' television show, the term &quot;White Walkers&quot; is used as an alternate name for a species called '''the Others''' in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels. They are held to be fairy stories by most of the people of Westeros. According to legend, the Others were creatures of ice and cold who, more than eight thousand years ago, came from the uttermost north during a winter that lasted a generation and a night that covered the world, the Long Night. The Others were defeated in the War for the Dawn by a great hero wielding a sword of flame. After the Others' defeat, Bran the Builder constructed [[the Wall]] with magic and artifice to ensure they could never return to threaten the people of [[Westeros]] and the world beyond. The War for the Dawn apparently unified the peoples of [[the North]] under the rule of the [[Starks]] and saw [[Winterfell]] built shortly thereafter.\n\nThe [[Night's Watch]] was founded to guard against the return of the Others, but this task is generally forgotten today. The Watch is instead believed to be guarding against the human [[Free Folk|wildlings]] who hold the lands beyond and occasionally try to raid across the Wall into the richer lands to the south.\n\nThe White Walkers are always accompanied by cold temperatures, and coming from the [[Lands of Always Winter]], it would seem that they prefer cold climates. They might even have difficulty surviving in warmer climates. Characters within the narrative debate whether this is because White Walkers actually generate cold and might even cause winters (such as the Long Night), or because they simply wait for the next winter cycle and move south when the temperature drops (in which case they didn't cause the Long Night, but seized on the opportunity it provided).  White Walkers do not leave footprints in snow.  \n\nSome of [[Old Nan]]'s fairy tales say that wildling women have been known to mate with the Others to produce half-human children, but this is an unsubstantiated rumor.\n\nIt is stated in the books that they fear the day and only come out at night.  In the Season 2 finale, however, they are seen in the twilight hours when the sun (hidden by heavy clouds) hasn't completely set yet.  The reason for this was most likely practical:  the White Walkers in the novels have only appeared in near pitch-darkness, and in the visual medium of television it would be difficult to strictly match this (i.e. even night scenes set in a forest seem curiously well-lit by the moon, so we the audience can see what is happening).  \n\nWhen stabbed with a dragonglass blade, an Other will melt into a pool of cold liquid. In the TV series, when they are stabbed by dragonglass they painfully freeze into ice, and quickly shatter and crumble into pieces.  \n\n===Naming===\nThe White Walkers are often known as &quot;the Others&quot; in the novels, and were still known by this name in the first draft of the pilot script. In the books, &quot;white walkers&quot; is the name given to the creatures by wildlings, and with only a few wildling characters, the term is heard only seldom. The name is also used in Westeros, though mostly by older characters such as [[Old Nan]], Maester [[Aemon]], and Lord Commander [[Jeor\u00c2\u00a0Mormont|Jeor&amp;nbsp;Mormont]].\n\nFan speculation was originally that the name was changed to avoid confusion with the faction of the same name in the television series ''Lost''. However, the producers later stated in the Season 1 Blu-ray commentary that the change was more to avoid viewer confusion between the specific name &quot;Others&quot; and the generic use of the term: book-readers can tell that &quot;Others&quot; is treated as a capitalized proper noun, but TV-viewers cannot. It sounded like actors saying, &quot;He says he saw the others&quot; - but viewers had no way of telling if they simply meant &quot;other soldiers&quot;, &quot;other horses&quot;, etc. - so the term was just too confusing in the audio-visual medium of television.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|The Others}}\n\n", "Powers": "White Walkers possess the magical\u00c2\u00a0powers related to ice and cold.

Prior to this, the White Walkers had massacred a tribe of wildlings and left the corpses out as a warning. His story was not believed by Lord [[Eddard Stark]], who executed him as a deserter.
