It resulted in the ouster of [[House Targaryen]] and the death of the majority of its members. [[House Baratheon]] became the new royal house after the war's conclusion.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, this civil war took place between sixteen and fourteen years before the beginning of the novels. In the books the conflict is also called the '''War of the Usurper''' by Targaryen loyalists.\n\nThe war was sparked when Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]\u00c2\u00a0allegedly kidnapped [[Lyanna Stark]]. When [[Rickard Stark|Lyanna's father]] and [[Brandon Stark (the elder)|eldest brother]] protested this act to King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], the Mad King had them both killed in front of the entire Royal Court. Aerys then called for the heads of Lyanna's betrothed, [[Robert Baratheon]], and her second brother [[Eddard Stark]], who were under the care of [[Jon Arryn]]. Lord Arryn raised his banners in rebellion against these unjust acts and sent Robert and Eddard back to their lands to rally their men.\n\n[[House Tully]] joined Robert's side after Eddard and Jon married [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] Tully, respectively, while [[House Tyrell]] and [[House Martell]] supported the Targaryens. While House Tully did support Robert, the always fractious lords of the Riverlands were heavily divided in the war, and many stayed loyal to the Targaryens. [[House Lannister]] sat out most of the war, only entering - on Robert's side - after Robert killed Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident and his victory was a foregone conclusion. \n\nThe rebellion climaxed with the [[Battle of the Trident]], when the rebel armies destroyed the royalist host and killed Prince Rhaegar. Lannister forces, apparently having decided to support the king, arrived at [[King's Landing]] to help defend the capital, but then turned on the Targaryens, brutally sacking the city and killing King [[Aerys II]] and Rhaegar's children. Aerys's other heirs, [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys|Daenerys Targaryen]],\u00c2\u00a0were spirited to safety\u00c2\u00a0across the sea by Targaryen loyalists before the\u00c2\u00a0garrison of Dragonstone (where the two children were being kept for their safety) could hand them over to Robert Baratheon. House Tyrell, whose main force had been held up in a lengthy siege at [[Storm's End]], proclaimed loyalty to Robert soon after the sacking of King's Landing when Eddard Stark arrived with an army to relieve the siege.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war it was discovered that Lyanna Stark had died, so Robert married [[Cersei Lannister]] in thanks for her father delivering him victory and to secure an alliance between the two houses.\n\n[[Elia Martell]]'s brutal murder by the Lannisters during the [[Sack of King's Landing]] earned them the lasting enmity of the Martells. As a result of Elia's unnecessary and easily avoidable murder, [[Dorne]] became a hotbed of pro-Targaryen sentiment and it took lengthy negotiations\u00c2\u00a0on the part of\u00c2\u00a0Jon Arryn for them to grudgingly swear fealty to Robert.\n\nSimilar to the Lannisters, [[House Greyjoy]] remained neutral throughout most of the war, under the rule of [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s father Lord Quellon.  He had been a strong ruler though by the rebellion his health was failing.  Quellon was not particularly loyal to either side, so he simply wanted the ironborn to wait out the war on the mainland.  After Rhaegar died, however, his sons convinced him that they should side with the rebels while they still could, both to get a share of the plunder and to placate Robert Baratheon, soon to be the new king.  They were not yet sure if Tywin Lannister would side with the Targaryens, so most of the [[Iron Fleet]] stayed home to defend against possible attack from the Westerlands.  Quellon himself led a raiding fleet of 50 ships to attack the west coast of the Reach.  They raided some soft targets, weakly defended villages and towns, but the Reach's main army was focused to the east at Storm's End.  At the mouth of the Mander, however, the ironborn were attacked by a dozen Reach ships from the [[Shield Islands]].  They defeated them but lost a dozen of their own ships in the exchange, and Quellon died in the fighting.  Balon then returned the fleet home.  Overall it was a minimal, token gesture meant to please Robert, with absolutely no significant impact on the war.  Characters in the main narrative of the novels have never even ''mentioned'' the Greyjoys' minimal activities in the war (Quellon's raiding is only known of through the ''World of Ice and Fire'' sourcebook).  The Greyjoys had no deep allegiance to Robert, however, and a few years later Balon attempted to declare independence from the mainland in the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].\n\n", "History": "===Background===\n[[File:Robert's_Rebellion_Title_Sequence.png|thumb||200px|The title sequence artistically depicts the Targaryen dragon falling to the Baratheon stag, Stark direwolf, and Lannister lion.]]\n[[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]], the Second of His Name, was the [[King of the Andals and the First Men|King of the Seven Kingdoms]] and the last member of [[House Targaryen]] to sit on the [[Iron Throne]].

As a result, tensions between House Targaryen and several other Great Houses began to rise.\u00c2\u00a0A final round of blood-letting, unleashed when his son [[Prince]] [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] kidnapped [[Lyanna Stark]] of [[Winterfell]], saw many Houses in the realm rebel against his rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebellion viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/roberts-rebellion/ HBO viewers guide, appendices, Robert's Rebellion entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhaegar viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/rhaegar-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Rhaegar Targaryen entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLyanna was a prominent noblewoman as the daughter of [[Rickard Stark]], [[Lord Paramount of the North]].
