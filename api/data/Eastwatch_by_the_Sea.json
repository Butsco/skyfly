From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.|[[Tyrion Lannister]] to [[Janos Slynt]]|The Night Lands}}\n'''Eastwatch''', or '''Eastwatch-by-the-Sea''', is a castle and port located at the far eastern end of [[the Wall]], where the Wall drops into an inlet of the [[Shivering Sea]] called the [[Bay of Seals]]. There are nineteen castles along the Wall, but as their numbers fell over the centuries the Night's Watch had to abandon sixteen of them. Eastwatch-by-the-Sea is one of only three manned castles left on [[the Wall]], along with [[Castle Black]] and [[The Shadow Tower]].\n\nAs the only castle on the Wall located on the sea, Eastwatch-by-the-Sea serves as the port for the [[Night's Watch]]. The capital city of [[King's Landing]], as well as the cities of [[White Harbor]] and [[Gulltown]], are also located on the eastern coast of the continent, so it is relatively easy for provisions and news to reach Eastwatch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/castle-black/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Castle Black entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Known residents": "\n*[[Cotter Pyke]], a bastard of the [[Iron Islands]], commander of the Eastwatch garrison.\n*[[Borcas]], head steward of Eastwatch.\n**[[Dareon]], a newly-made steward, assigned to Eastwatch.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Eastwatch-by-the-Sea serves as the main resupply post for the Night's Watch, with ships stopping there from King's Landing, the [[Free Cities]] far to the south, the island of [[Ibben]], and even some wildling fisherfolk who are permitted to trade there. There is also some clandestine smuggling going on there, which is tolerated only as far as that it helps the Watch. The Night's Watch possesses a small &quot;fleet&quot; of ships at Eastwatch, but they are not frequently used and thus often left unmanned and tied up at anchor.\n\nAt the start of the books, less than 200 soldiers are based at the Eastwatch.\n\nIn the novels, it is specified that when King [[Stannis Baratheon]] sailed to the Wall to save the Night's Watch during the [[Battle of Castle Black]], his forces landed at Eastwatch, then proceeded west along the north side of the Wall until they reached Castle Black.  Black brothers from Eastwatch came with them, to lead them along Ranger paths used in scouting beyond the Wall, so they could reach Castle Black in time.  \n\n===Naming===\nIn the novels, the castle is named Eastwatch-by-the-Sea almost constantly. In the TV series, it is called &quot;Eastwatch&quot; the one time it is mentioned in dialogue in the first season, as well as on the map on the [[HBO]] website. However, in the second season it was also called &quot;Eastwatch-by-the-Sea&quot; on-screen, indicating that the two terms are interchangeable. Jon Snow also refers to it in Season 3 by the full name &quot;Eastwatch-by-the-Sea&quot;.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\nDareon is assigned to the Stewards and [[Maester]] [[Aemon]] sends him to Eastwatch and ordered to report to [[Borcas]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] tells [[Jon Snow]] that four of Cotter Pyke's men found four [[wights]] in the snow near Eastwatch.
