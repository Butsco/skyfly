It began approximately 10,000 years ago with the sealing of [[the Pact]], which [[Wars of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|brought about peace]] between the [[First Men]] and the [[Children of the Forest]], and lasted for several thousand years until the [[Andal invasion]].\n\nThis age is so-named for the great heroes who were said to live at this time and perform immense deeds. Some of these heroes include [[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Bran the Builder]] and [[Lann the Clever]], whose descendants founded [[House Stark]] and [[House Lannister]] respectively. The major historical event of this age was the [[Long Night]] and the war against the [[White Walkers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VG Westeros Through The Ages&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/beyond-the-houses/ HBO Viewer's Guide, Season 2 appendices Westeros Through the Ages]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Age of Heroes"}
