He is played by guest star [[Ciaran Bermingham]] and debuts in &quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]].&quot; Mord is the turnkey at [[the Eyrie]]. [[Tyrion Lannister]] has to negotiate with him after being thrown into the Sky Cells.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mord is a petty, dimwitted, and cruel man who delights in tormenting prisoners and telling them how they are going to fall out of the cells to their deaths on the rocks six hundred feet below the castle. He took [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s coat when he first got there and the nights are freezing.\n\nMord is described as very unattractive person: he has small dark eyes and rotting brown teeth. The left side of his face is scarred where an axe cut off his ear and part of his cheek. He has a large belly and thick, stubby-fingered hands.\n\nAfter [[Petyr Baelish]] kills [[Lysa Arryn]] and puts the blame on [[Marillion]], Mord tortures Marillion by plucking his eyes and cutting several of his fingers, till he breaks down and confesses falsely that he killed Lysa. When [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] looks at Mord, she notices that he has gold teeth.\n\n&quot;Mord&quot; means &quot;murder&quot; in Norwegian, Danish, German, Swedish and Polish, though it is uncertain if George R. R. Martin had any knowledge of this when he created the name.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "\nActor Peter Dinklage was not wearing padding, and the scene where Mord beats him with a truncheon, even though it was a prop one, left him with bruises.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season One Appearances|5=yes|6=yes}}\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nMord is the gaoler in charge of the sky cells in [[the Eyrie]]. He is in the service of [[House Arryn]]. He is slow witted and follows the orders of his &quot;betters.&quot;\u00c2\u00a0 He is not so slow that he does not recognize opportunity when it is presented and he is the only reason Tyrion was able to make his play for freedom.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[File:Tyrion and Mord.jpg|thumb|Mord beats Tyrion]]\n[[Tyrion Lannister]] is given into Mord's redoubtable care while a prisoner at the Eyrie.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While Tyrion is trapped in the Sky Cells he tries to bargain for his freedom. Mord responds by beating him because he has no money to pay with. With great difficulty, Tyrion manages to bargain with Mord to allow him a fair hearing with [[Lysa Arryn]], under the promise &quot;a Lannister always pays his debts&quot;. Tyrion is able to manipulate the situation during his audience with Lysa to demand a [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]], which is won in his favor by [[Bronn]]. Set free, Tyrion asks for his money-purse back from [[Rodrik Cassel]]. As Tyrion turns to leave, true to his word, he tosses the gold-filled purse to Mord, much to Mord's delight.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Mord"}
