Theon berates [[Lorren]] for allowing them to escape. When Lorren counters that Theon is also to blame for sleeping with Osha and letting his guard down, Theon furiously beats him. Theon leads the ironborn on horse to hunt down the boys with hounds to track them. The search leads them to a shepherd's farm, but the farmer says that he hasn't seen anyone. Dagmer finds some walnut shells, so they know that Bran and Rickon were there, but the hounds can't get the scent. Theon tells them the hunt is over and to return Maester Luwin to Winterfell: he knows where they are, and his mercy has been exhausted.\n\n[[File:Burned bodies.jpg|thumb|Theon has the burned bodies raised on the walls of Winterfell]]\nTheon returns to Winterfell with two children's bodies burned beyond recognition, and he has them hoisted to either side of the main gate. Maester Luwin cries out in grief when he sees them.\n\nAt [[Harrenhal]], [[Tywin Lannister]] is discussing the assassination of [[Amory Lorch]] with Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. Tywin is convinced that it was an assassination attempt on himself, unaware that [[Jaqen H'ghar]] actually killed Lorch on the request of [[Arya Stark]]. Ser Gregor speculates that the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] may have been responsible. Enraged, Tywin orders Gregor to burn out villages and farms in reprisal for this assassination attempt. Tywin later suspects that Arya is highborn, because she doesn't pronounce &quot;M'Lord&quot; the way commoners do, instead saying &quot;My Lord&quot;, and possesses an educated vocabulary. Arya makes the excuse that her mother taught her to speak properly.\n\nIn [[King's Landing]], [[Sansa Stark]] comes to thank [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane]] for saving her life during [[Riot of King's Landing|the recent riot]] in the city and says that he was very brave. Sandor simply says that a dog doesn't need courage to fight off rats. Sansa is perturbed by his &quot;hateful speech&quot;, but Sandor cautions that a day will come when his cynical speech is all that stands between her and her &quot;beloved&quot; King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].\n\n[[File:Caught.jpg|thumb|Sansa and Shae trying to flip the mattress.]]\nSansa awakens in her bed from a nightmare, only to find the sheets covered in blood - she has [[Flowering|begun menstruating]] for the first time. Given that Joffrey [[Fire and Blood|openly promised]] to rape Sansa to &quot;put a son in you&quot; as soon as she had her blood, she then frantically tries to get rid of the bloody sheets to remove the evidence. [[Shae]] tries to help Sansa hide the sheets but Sandor finds them.\n\nTerrified of being brought to Joffrey, Sansa is instead brought before Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]], who awkwardly tries to comfort her. Cersei presents Sansa with warped advice on Joffrey, bizarre counseling based on her bitter marriage with King [[Robert Baratheon]]. Blithely waving away her son's torment of Sansa and homicidal outbursts she says that her brother [[Jaime Lannister]] stayed by her side the whole time she was giving birth to Joffrey, but Sansa should never expect such devotion from Joffrey. Cersei firmly believes that Sansa and Joffrey not being in love is a good thing; she advises Sansa &quot;the more people you love, the weaker you are.&quot; Cersei says that no one expects her to love Joffrey, though she may take comfort in her love for the children they will have.\n\nPrivately, Cersei meets with Tyrion and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime. She wonders if Joffrey's violent personality is the price of her and Jaime's sins. Tyrion earnestly points out that her other two children, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], are not monsters, and they share an odd moment of sympathy.\n\n[[File:Alton's body.jpg|thumb|[[Torrhen Karstark]] discovers the body of [[Alton Lannister]].]]\nAt King [[Robb Stark]]'s army camp in [[the Westerlands]], close to an unidentified keep, [[Alton Lannister]] returns as an envoy giving [[The Night Lands|Queen Cersei's response]] to Robb's peace terms. Robb is unsurprised that she rejected them and imprisons\u00c2\u00a0Alton with his cousin\u00c2\u00a0[[Jaime Lannister]].\u00c2\u00a0The nurse [[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]] discusses medical supplies she needs with Robb. Robb suggests she accompany him to\u00c2\u00a0[[the Crag]] to acquire the supplies she needs. That night,\u00c2\u00a0Jaime kills Alton to lure the guard, [[Torrhen Karstark]], into his cell. Jaime strangles Torrhen and escapes, but is soon recaptured. Torrhen was the son of Lord [[Rickard Karstark]], one of the major nobles from the North. Lord Rickard demands Jaime's execution in revenge, regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is forced to argue for Jaime's life. Catelyn confronts Jaime and tells him that he has no honor. Jaime bitterly explains that his vows as a knight required him to defend the innocent and serve the king, but [[Aerys II Targaryen|his king]] was slaughtering the innocent. Jaime considers concepts like &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;loyalty&quot; naive at best and hypocritical at worst. Jaime asserts that he has only been with Cersei and begins to ridicule [[Eddard Stark]], Catelyn's late husband, by bringing up the shame of Eddard fathering a bastard. This brings Catelyn to breaking point and she asks for [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]'s sword.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\n[[Jon Snow]] is still separated from the [[Night's Watch]] scouting group led by [[Qhorin Halfhand]]. He attempts to locate them, traveling with his [[Free Folk|wildling]] prisoner [[Ygritte]]. She argues with Jon, criticizing him for ignoring their common descent from the [[First Men]]. She states that the animosity of the southerners to the Wildlings is arbitrary, given that the Wildlings are only distinguished from them by living north of the Wall when it was constructed. She mocks Jon's sexual repression and surmises that he is a virgin. She taunts him by offering to teach him how to have sex. She escapes and leads him into an ambush. Ygritte says that Jon should have taken her when he had the chance.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\nIn [[Qarth]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is desperate to find her stolen [[dragons]]. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] returns and she orders him to find them. [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] claims to be distressed at breaking his promise to protect her, fearing that his word will be publicly seen as worthless. Jorah questions [[Quaithe]] of [[Asshai]]. Quaithe knows that Jorah once betrayed Daenerys by spying on her. Quaithe warns Jorah that the man who stole the dragons is already with Daenerys. Jorah finds Daenerys, in the company of [[Kovarro]], pleading with the council of [[The Thirteen]] to find her dragons. The warlock [[Pyat Pree]] confesses to stealing the dragons and declares Xaro the King of Qarth. Doubles of the warlock then magically appear behind the other members of the Thirteen and slit their throats, leaving only Pyat Pree and Xaro. Xaro secretly entered into an alliance with Pyat Pree to become king.\u00c2\u00a0Pyat\u00c2\u00a0Pree\u00c2\u00a0urges\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys to find her dragons at the [[House of the Undying]] as the three fled.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Charles Dance]] as Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as Prince [[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Richard Madden]] as King [[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Sophie Turner]] as Princess [[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as Prince [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as [[Shae]]\n*[[Rory McCann]] as [[Sandor Clegane]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Guest starring'''\n*[[Donald Sumpter]] as Maester [[Luwin]]\n*[[Ian Hanmore]] as [[Pyat Pree]]\n*[[Nicholas Blane]] as the [[Spice King]]\n*[[Nonso Anozie]] as [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]]\n*[[Michael McElhatton]] as Lord [[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Rose Leslie]] as [[Ygritte]]\n*[[Gwendoline Christie]] as [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Oona Chaplin]] as [[Talisa Maegyr]]\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as [[Dagmer|Dagmer Cleftjaw]]\n*[[Laura Pradelska]] as [[Quaithe]]\n*[[John Stahl]] as Lord [[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Karl Davies]] as Ser [[Alton Lannister]]\n*[[Forbes KB]] as [[Lorren|Black Lorren]]\n*[[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n*[[Steven Cole]] as [[Kovarro]]\n*[[Ian Whyte]] as Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Art Parkinson]] as Prince [[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Donagh Deeney]] as a [[Winterfell shepherd]]\n*[[Sara Dylan]] as a [[Unidentified handmaiden|Handmaid]]\n*[[Steve Wilson]] as [[Theon's master of hounds]]\n*[[Slavko Juraga]] as the [[Thirteen member]]\n*[[Tyrone McElhennon]] as [[Torrhen Karstark]]\n*[[Neill Fleming]] as a [[Karstark soldier 1|Karstark soldier]]\n*[[Peter Ballance]] as [[Farlen]]\n*[[David Coakley]] as [[Drennan]]\n*[[Paul Caddell]] as [[Jacks]]\n*[[Duncan Lacroix]] as a [[Karstark soldier 2|Karstark soldier]]\n*[[David Sheehan|David Sheenan]] (sic) as a [[Stark guard 1 (A Man Without Honor)|Stark guard]]\n*[[Aidan Crowe]] as [[Quent]]\n*[[Reg Wayment]] as a [[King's Landing rioter 1|rioter]]\n\n'''Uncredited'''\n*Unknown as [[Palla]]\n*Unknown as [[Billy]]\n*Unknown as [[Jack]]\n*Unknown as [[Malakho]]\n*Unknown as a [[Stark guard (The Old Gods and the New)|Stark guard]]\n*Unknown as the [[Silk King]]\n*Unknown as the [[Copper King]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n*Only 15 of the 25 starring cast members for the second season appear in this episode.\n*Starring cast members [[John Bradley]] ([[Samwell Tarly]]), [[James Cosmo]] ([[Jeor Mormont]]), [[Liam Cunningham]] ([[Davos Seaworth]]), [[Stephen Dillane]] ([[Stannis Baratheon]]), [[Natalie Dormer]] ([[Margaery Tyrell]]), [[Jerome Flynn]] ([[Bronn]]), [[Aidan Gillen]] ([[Petyr Baelish]]), [[Jack Gleeson]] ([[Joffrey Baratheon]]), [[Conleth Hill]] ([[Varys]]), and [[Carice van Houten]] ([[Melisandre]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n*Guest star [[David Sheehan]]'s name is spelled incorrectly in the credits as David Sheenan.\n\n", "Notes": "*The title of the episode comes from a line by [[Catelyn Stark]] to [[Jaime Lannister]], the Kingslayer: &quot;You are a man without honor.&quot;\n*Tywin Lannister states that the current civil war in the Seven Kingdoms is being called &quot;the War of Five Kings&quot;. This is the first time that the conflict has been named on-screen - though the formal name is ultimately the &quot;[[War of the Five Kings]]&quot;. It is referred to in dialogue as the &quot;War of ''the'' Five Kings&quot; [[The Lion and the Rose|in Season 4]].\n*In the &quot;ThronesCast&quot; interview series, actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (who plays Jaime Lannister) mysteriously refers to a scene in this episode as his favorite moment in the series and his favorite scene he's ever acted in. He later explained in the HBO featurette for this episode that he was referring to the scene between Jaime and Alton Lannister.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Man Without Honor&quot; HBO featurette&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Tyrion made similar comments to Ygritte's back in Season 1 when he visited the Wall, pointing out that the &quot;[[Free Folk|wildlings]]&quot; are basically just those people whose ancestors were unfortunate enough to happen to be living north of the Wall when it was built. Both the inhabitants of [[the North]] (south of the Wall, ruled by the Starks) and the wildlings are descended from the [[First Men]]. They have much closer ethnic ties to each other than the foreign [[Andal]] invaders who now dominate all of southern Westeros. Both groups even have the same religion, worshiping the [[Old Gods of the Forest]], as [[Osha]] pointed out in Season 1.\n*According to episode director David Nutter, the episode was filmed not long after the footage of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's death was circulating heavily in the news, during which Gaddafi was surrounded by a frenzied mob eager to exact &quot;eye for an eye&quot; vengeance. Nutter said that he was loosely inspired by the visual energy of this footage when he was shooting the scene in which Jaime Lannister has been recaptured after killing Rickard Karstark's son, and is dragged back into camp by an angry mob of Northern soldiers who want to immediately kill him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Man Without Honor&quot; HBO featurette&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Memorable quotes": "'''[[Sansa Stark]]''': &quot;I beg pardon, Ser.
