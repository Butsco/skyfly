Myr is a major seaport located on a large body of water known as the [[Sea of Myrth]], an inlet of the [[Narrow Sea]]. It is located south of [[Pentos]] and north of the [[Disputed Lands]].\n\nPeople of Myr are known as '''Myrish'''. Myrish craftsmen are renowned throughout the known world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/myr/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Myr entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Myrish lace is a particularly highly sought after commodity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/myr/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Myr entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Myr has a reputation for great craftsmanship: it is famed for its expertise in creating mirrors and lenses, and intricate Myrish lace is a much sought-after textile product. It has a strong military, with its crossbowmen being particularly famed. Myr has been locked in a bitter rivalry with the [[Free City]] of [[Lys]] for centuries.\n\nMyr is ruled by [[Magisters]] and has its own language derived from [[High Valyrian]]. Its people are noted for being dark-haired and dark-eyed, with olive-colored skin, and are considered exotic-looking by Westerosi standards.\n\nLike most of the other Free Cities, Myr was once a colony of [[Valyria]]. After the Doom, it became independent but was conquered a few years later by [[Volantis]], which was trying to rebuild the fallen empire. When Volantis overreached and attacked [[Tyrosh]] as well, it was beaten back and defeated by a coalition including the Westerosi Storm King, troops from [[Pentos]] and [[Braavos]] and massive uprisings in Myr and Lys. Volantis's military power was broken and Myr again became an independent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_state city-state].\n\nThe alliances soon fell apart, however, so that [[Myr]] and [[Lys]] have been perpetually warring with each other for the better part of the past three hundred years. The &quot;[[Disputed Lands]]&quot;, between Myr to the north and Lys to the south, are so-called because they are constantly changing hands back and forth between the two cities according to the changing fortunes of their conflicts. [[Tyrosh]] and [[Volantis]] have been drawn into this feud from time to time, allying with either Myr or Lys as the alliances shift.\n\nAccording to the Game of Thrones RPG, Myr is pronounced &quot;Mire&quot;, and uses the adjective &quot;Mire-ish&quot;. However, in Season 3 [[Thoros]] (of Myr) pronounces it as &quot;Meer&quot; (rhymes with &quot;deer&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.\n\n", "Notable Myrish": "*[[Thoros]]\u00c2\u00a0of [[Myr]], a red priest of the [[R'hllor|Lord of Light]] and a member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].\u00c2\u00a0\n\n"}, "title": "Myr"}
