It consists of a strong, fortified castle and a town that sprawls around it. It is a town built largely of mud and straw. The town's largest structure is [[Spear Tower]], a 150-feet structure with a pinnacle of shining steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/sunspear/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Sunspear entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\u00c2\u00a0(spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Sunspear is the principal stronghold of House Martell. It is located on the far-eastern coast of Dorne and consists of two strong towers, the Spear Tower and the Tower of the Sun, the latter of which contains the Prince of Dorne's throne room. The castle walls are sand-colored, setting it apart from the other major castles of [[Westeros]].\n\nSunspear is surrounded by the shadow town, which consists of shops, markets and bazaars. The town is also walled, though more buildings - mostly mud-brick hovels - stretch beyond it. The castle and town also have a modest harbor. Areo Hotah, who is from the Free Cities, notes that the town around Sunspear isn't really large enough to be considered a true &quot;city&quot; on the scale of Norvos, Pentos, or King's Landing, but it is still the largest settlement in Dorne.\n\n===Notable residents of the castle===\n* Prince [[Doran Martell]], the ruler of Dorne in the name of the [[King of the Andals and the First Men|King]].\n**Princess Arianne Martell, Prince Doran's firstborn daughter and heir.\n** Prince [[Trystane Martell]], Prince Doran's youngest child.\n* Prince {[[Oberyn Martell]]}, called the Red Viper, Prince Doran's younger brother.\n**[[Ellaria Sand]] \u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;, Prince Oberyn's [[paramour]] and mother of the four youngest Sand Snakes.\n*** The [[Sand Snakes]], Prince Oberyn's eight bastard daughters.\n*[[Areo Hotah]], Doran's trusted captain of the guards.
