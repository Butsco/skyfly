Their name is &quot;the Windblown&quot; because they say the wind blows them around from one city to the next in Essos, looking for employers who will contract them to fight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sellswords &amp; Hedge Knights (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt; \n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (Major spoilers from the novels)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Windblown were founded about thirty years ago by a newly elected prince from [[Pentos]], known only as the Tattered Prince (due to his habit of taking strips of cloth from the surcoats of men he has killed in personal combat, then adding them to his motley cloak). He is an elegant and dignified old man who is nonetheless ruthless to deserters.  When he was 23 years old, the [[magisters]] selected him as the new [[Prince of Pentos]] after beheading the last prince for failure. Rather than accept the honor - a dangerous position as a glorified scapegoat -, he ran to the [[Disputed Lands]] to become a sellsword, and never returned. Over time he established his own sellsword company.  \n\nBecause the Windblown include members from all over the world, including [[Westeros]]i exiles, the only common language they can use is [[High Valyrian]], which the Tattered Prince shouts out commands to his men in.  \n\n"}, "title": "Windblown"}
