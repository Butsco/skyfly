Neither of them were absolutely confirmed to be playing these characters, however, as their names were never stated in on-screen dialogue or in the credits. McKeever reappeared in Seasons [[Season 2|2]] and [[Season 3|3]] in a background role in the [[Great Ranging]], in which Yarwyck didn't partake. In [[Season 4]], Fortune's character was directly identified in on-screen dialogue as Yarwyck, and [[Michael Condron]] was subsequently cast as Marsh for [[Season 5]]. This establishes that Fortune's character should always be considered to have been Yarwyck, while McKeever was simply playing an unnamed Night's Watch officer. While this might technically be a retcon, Season 1 never absolutely confirmed which characters these actors were playing, so it introduced no internal continuity errors.\n\nIn the books, about a dozen loyal Night's Watch members managed to escape from the [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep]] and return to Castle Black. The TV series, however, explicitly showed Jon Snow, Samwell Tarly, Edd, and Grenn are the only black brothers who went on the expedition north of the Wall who managed to return alive. The books also never explicitly showed what happened to the [[Betrayers|Mutineers]] after the mutiny, but the TV series did, and no other loyalists were shown to have survived. Therefore, it is tacitly presented that McKeever's character died during the mutiny.\n\n", "TOP": "Night's Watch Officer 20235101720layxst994h7ba0kww2oy6ahls771671342014-12-06T22:18:38ZThe Snow Prince24099677{{Heraldry\n|image=Crow mini shield.png\n|link=Night's Watch\n}}\n\n{{Character\n|Title = [[File:Crow mini shield.png|30px|left|link=Night's Watch]] [[File:Crow mini shield.png|30px|right|link=Night's Watch]] Night's Watch&lt;br&gt; Officer\n|Season = [[Season 1|1]], [[Season 2|2]], [[Season 3|3]]\n|Image=NightsWatchOfficerSeason3.jpg\n|First = &quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;\n|Last = \n|Appearances = 6 episodes &lt;small&gt;([[#Appearances|see below]])&lt;/small&gt;\n|Titles =\n| Status= [[:Category:Status: Dead|Deceased]]\n|Allegiance = The [[Night's Watch]]\n|Actor = [[Dennis McKeever]]}}A\u00c2\u00a0'''Night's Watch Officer''' is a recurring background character in the [[Season 1|first]], [[Season 2|second]] and [[Season 3|third]] seasons.
