It is the seat of [[House Marbrand]], a noble house sworn to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. It is located close to where the [[Tumblestone]] river begins, southeast of [[the Crag]] and northeast of Casterly Rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/ashemark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Ashemark entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ashemark is the seat of House Marbrand.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Oxcross]] opened up the northern Westerlands to [[Robb Stark]]'s army, his forces easily captured Ashemark.  For some reason, the TV series doesn't refer to a minor engagement at the &quot;Battle of Ashemark&quot;, instead referring to a &quot;[[Battle of the Yellow Fork]]&quot; taking place around the same point.  It seems that they changed the name to avoid confusion with [[Ashford]], which is a castle in the Reach.  It's possible that the &quot;Yellow Fork&quot; is meant to be the tributary of the Tumblestone, which is itself a tributary of the [[Trident]] River system, with its three main forks also named after colors:  Red, Blue, and Green.  \n\n"}, "title": "Ashemark"}
