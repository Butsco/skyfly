The forest is settled by crofters, foresters and hunters. [[House Glover]] of [[Deepwood Motte]] controls much of the territory of the Wolfswood.  Sub-vassals of the Glovers who also live in the Wolfswood include [[House Forrester]], House Woods, House Branch, and House Bole]. Despite these woodsmen, overall the forest is thinly populated, wild and untamed.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Bran Stark]] is attacked by [[wildlings]] in the Wolfswood, before being rescued by [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Wolfswood"}
