The holder is ruler of the entire region of [[the Stormlands]].\n\nThe Stormlands were originally a sovereign nation known as ''The Storm Kingdom'' until [[Aegon the Conqueror]] arrived in [[Westeros]] and formed the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Aegon Targaryen sent his bastard brother [[Orys Baratheon]] to secure the Stormlands, making him the first Lord of Storm's End.\n\nFormer holder [[Robert Baratheon]] passed the title to his infant brother, [[Renly Baratheon]] when he became the [[King on the Iron Throne]] following [[Robert's Rebellion]]. This has left [[Stannis Baratheon]] with issues of resentment towards Robert since he feels as though he should have been the Lord of Storm's End as Renly's older brother. Before Robert the title was held by his father [[Steffon Baratheon]].\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nDuring the [[War of the Five Kings]], the red priestess [[Melisandre]] uses her magic to create a [[shadow]] to kill [[Renly Baratheon|King Renly Baratheon]]. Following Renly's death, Stannis took Storm's End as his own, making him the Lord of Storm's End.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Lords of Storm's End==\n*{[[Steffon Baratheon]]}\n*{[[Robert Baratheon]]}\n*{[[Renly Baratheon]]}, app\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;ointed\u00c2\u00a0by King Robert Baratheon, killed by Stannis Baratheon\n*[[Stannis Baratheon]],\u00c2\u00a0current Lord of Storm's End\n\n===Historical Lords of Storm's End===\n*[[Orys Baratheon]]\n\n"}, "title": "Lord of Storm's End"}
