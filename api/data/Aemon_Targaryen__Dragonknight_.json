And the man was one of Aegon's own Kingsguard.|[[Bronn]]|The Kingsguard  (Histories &amp; Lore)}}\n'''Aemon Targaryen''' is an unseen character in ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He is long dead by the time of the series. He was a [[Prince]] of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]]\u00c2\u00a0and the namesake of Maester [[Aemon]]. He was the uncle of Maester Aemon's grandfather, King Daeron II.\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Targaryen family tree Regency Conquest of Dorne era}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the [[A Song of Ice and Fire|''A Song of Ice and Fire'']] novels,\u00c2\u00a0Aemon was knighted young and joined the Kingsguard at the age of seventeen. He served under five kings: His uncle [[Aegon III Targaryen]], his cousins [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron the Young Dragon]] and [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]], his father [[Viserys II Targaryen|Viserys II]], and his brother [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]]. Aemon\u00c2\u00a0has been referred to as the noblest and greatest knight that ever lived and his skills with a sword were legendary throughout Westeros.\n\nAemon took part in the conquest of Dorne, led by his cousin and king, Daeron I. Aemon won great fame by defeating a Dornish champion, and was present several years later after a rebellion in Dorne undid Daeron's conquest, and in which Daeron himself was killed. Aemon was taken captive by the Dornish, and put in a cage, placed above a pit filled with vipers. He was eventually saved by his cousin and new king, Baelor I.\n\nSongs speak of his doomed love for his brother's queen, his own sister, [[Naerys Targaryen|Naerys]]. He supposedly cried when Naerys married their brother. After his brother Aegon became king, rumors started to spread that Aemon was the actual father of Aegon's son and heir, Prince [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron]]. He defended his sister when she was accused of treason by the knight Ser\u00c2\u00a0Morgil.\n\nAemon once fought [[Cregan Stark]]. Prince Aemon claimed he had never faced a finer swordsman.\n\nAemon once won a tourney, disguised as a mystery knight, after his brother had forbidden him from participating because he wanted to name his mistress at the time the [[Queen of Love and Beauty]]. Aemon\u00c2\u00a0took part secretly under the disguise of ''The Knight of Tears,'' and was thus able to crown his sister Naerys the Queen of Love and Beauty, in place of the king's mistress.\n\nDespite the difficult relationship between Aemon and his brother, Aemon\u00c2\u00a0died honorably defending his brother and king from the [[House Toyne|brothers]] of Ser [[Terrence Toyne]], who wanted to assassinate Aegon IV in revenge for him executing Terrence for sleeping with his mistress.\n\nMaester [[Aemon]] explicitly states that his grandfather Daeron II named him after Aemon the Dragonknight, who was Daeron II's uncle - though Maester Aemon notes there are those who said that the Dragonknight was actually Daeron II's own father, depending on which tale you believe.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nPrince Aemon was called &quot;the Dragonknight&quot; on account of his heritage. He was raised to the [[Kingsguard]] at age 17 and eventually became [[Lord Commander]]. According to tradition, he was once saved from a snake pit by his cousin\u00c2\u00a0[[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor I Targaryen]], whom the snakes refused to bite. He fought and barely defeated Lord [[Cregan Stark]]. He also wielded [[Dark Sister]], the [[Valyrian steel]] sword of [[Visenya Targaryen]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\n\nAemon the Dragonknight's deeds are recorded in ''[[The Book of Brothers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Aemon Targaryen}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Aemon Targaryen (Dragonknight)"}
