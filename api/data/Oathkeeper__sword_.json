While initially given to [[Jaime Lannister]] by Lord Tywin with the intention of making it an heirloom of their house, Jaime instead gave it to [[Brienne of Tarth]]\u00c2\u00a0for the task of rescuing [[Sansa Stark]].\u00c2\u00a0Its sister blade is [[Widow's Wail]].\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF|Oathkeeper}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels, the sword is forged by [[Tobho Mott]] along with [[Widow's Wail]]. The sword has black and red ripples through the steel. Its scabbard glitters gold and is decorated with a row of lion's heads and smoldering red rubies. The pommel has a golden lion's head with ruby eyes that shine like two red stars.\n\nJaime is angry when the sword is given to him, thinking that it is a cruel jape of his father and uncle. [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] is upset to hear how Jaime feels about the sword, saying the gift was heartfelt, but Jaime is not mollified.\n\nAfter returning to King's Landing, a short time after the [[Purple Wedding]], Jaime and Brienne are stopped by Ser [[Loras Tyrell]], who believes that Brienne was responsible for [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]'s death. Jaime orders Brienne to be locked up for her own protection, thus when Jaime gives her sword she is in a tower cell, not the White Sword Tower. He also suggests the name &quot;Oathkeeper&quot; to her, claiming it is appropriate that she will be defending [[Sansa Stark|Ned Stark's daughter]] with Ned Stark's own steel.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 4]]===\n[[File:6de15b65107d9de914ca800c1ec637ba.png|thumb|Oathkeeper's hilt as seen in &quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;.]]\nTywin gives the sword to his son Jaime, intending for him to be released from his vows as Lord Commander of the [[Kingsguard]] and rule over [[Casterly Rock]] in his stead. When Jaime refuses, Tywin lets him keep the sword anyway and tells him that a one-handed man needs all the help possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s death, Jaime tasks [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] with finding [[Sansa Stark]] and get her somewhere safe before Cersei locates her. As a parting gift he gives her the sword, as he knows it was reforged from Ice, so she can protect [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]'s daughter with Ned Stark's own blade. She considers a name for a few moments, before choosing &quot;Oathkeeper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen Brienne and Podrick encounter [[Arya Stark]] and [[Sandor Clegane]], Oathkeeper's Lannister qualities cause Arya and Sandor to be suspicious of Brienne. When the situation turns hostile, Brienne uses Oathkeeper in combat for the first time against Sandor. However, she wins the duel by knocking Sandor off a cliff after brutal hand-to-hand combat.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Children]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Oathkeeper (sword)"}
