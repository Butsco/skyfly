The city is also located on the River Qhoyne, a tributary of the vast Rhoyne, and Qohorik warships control the territory south to Dagger Lake.\n\nQohor is famed for its blacksmiths, craftsmen and metal-workers. Its citizens worship a deity known as the Black Goat.\n\n&quot;Qohor&quot; is pronounced &quot;Kwoh-hor&quot;, as opposed to &quot;koh-hor&quot; (Jorah pronounces it &quot;kwoh-hor&quot;: if it was &quot;koh-hor&quot; it would have just been spelled &quot;Kohor&quot; with a &quot;K&quot;).\n\n===Location===\nQohor is shown in the incorrect location on the Season 2 Viewer's Guide map. This map has Qohor north-west of its proper location, on the wrong tributary of the Rhoyne (and much further away from the Forest of Qohor). However, the &quot;Areas of Control&quot; map for Season 2 puts Qohor in its correct location, matching that of the novels.\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nSoon after the [[Doom of Valyria]], four hundred years before the War of the Five Kings, Valyria's outlying colonies in Essos were thrown into chaos. As the colonies formed into the modern Free Cities, without the Valyrians and their [[dragons]] to hold them in check anymore, the [[Dothraki]] mounted hordes burst forth from the [[Dothraki Sea|central plains of Essos]], rampaging across the continent. [[Khal]] [[Temmo]] led his [[khalasar]] numbering in the tens of thousands towards Qohor, intending to raze the city completely. However, the horde was decisively defeated in the resulting [[Battle of Qohor]], by 3,000 [[Unsullied]] warrior-eunuchs purchased from [[Astapor]]. Temmo himself as well as his sons were killed, and Qohor was saved.\n\nQohor is still the closest of the Free Cities to the Dothraki Sea, but ever since Temmo's defeat it has been guarded by a standing garrison of Unsullied purchased from Slaver's Bay.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\nThe [[khalasar]] of [[Khal Drogo]] passes close to Qohor during their journey to [[Vaes Dothrak]]. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] takes advantage of their proximity to procure more supplies, but in reality, to also send word to [[Varys]] that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Ned Stark]] visits the forge of the blacksmith [[Tobho Mott]], a Qohorik master-armorer who moved to [[King's Landing]] many years ago.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Qohor"}
