Almost immediately, [[Eddard Stark|Lord Eddard Stark]] is asked to attend a meeting of the king's [[small council]]. Before that he encounters [[Jaime Lannister]] in the throne room. Jaime is still unhappy that Eddard judged him dishonorable for killing the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], the murderer of Eddard's [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]]. Jaime is unrepentant about it. Eddard meets the council members: Lord [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish]], the king's [[Master of Coin]] and a friend of Eddard's wife from childhood; [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]], the king's adviser in all matters scientific and academic; Lord [[Renly Baratheon]], the youngest of the king's two brothers and [[Master of Laws]]; and [[Varys]], a [[Eunuchs|eunuch]] and the [[Master of Whisperers]] (the head of the king's intelligence network).\n\nVarys tells Eddard that the council members heard about his &quot;troubles on the Kingsroad&quot; and that they pray for [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s recovery. Eddard grimly responds &quot;It's a shame no one prayed for the [[Mycah|butcher's boy]]&quot;, which visibly upsets Varys.\n\nEddard is stunned to learn that the crown is six million [[Currency|Gold Dragons]] in debt, half of which is to Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. To make matters worse, [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]] has just ordered a lavish [[tournament]] to celebrate Eddard's appointment. He resolves to advise Robert to cancel the tournament, but the council is doubtful that the King will listen.\n\n[[File:Cersei-joffrey.png|thumb|Cersei and her son Joffrey.]][[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] talks to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] about the incident on the river. She tells him that when he is king, the truth will be whatever he decides it will be. Joffrey thinks there will be trouble with the Starks, and promises that when he is king, he will double their taxes, force them to contribute to a standing army and, should they object, crush them and install someone loyal, such as his great-uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], as [[Warden]] of [[the North]]. Cersei points out that [[the North]] is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders, and a king needs to be more clever. She also advises him to be kind to his betrothed [[Sansa Stark]] to avoid stirring up trouble for later, and concludes that &quot;Anyone who isn't [[House Lannister|us]] is an enemy.&quot;\n\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and Sansa are still at odds over the incident with Joffrey and her direwolf. Eddard explains that Sansa was put in a difficult position by the king and queen, and while she shouldn't have lied, winning the long-term approval of Joffrey, her future husband, was important. Arya is unhappy with the situation, but Eddard mollifies her by allowing her to practice with her sword, [[Needle]].\n\n[[File:Bran and Old Nan 1x02.png|thumb|Old Nan tells Bran of winter and the Long Night.]]At [[Winterfell]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] has awoken, but has no memory of his accident. His injuries have left him bed-ridden and unlikely to walk again. [[Old Nan]], the oldest servant in the castle, tells Bran stories to pass the time, but he doesn't want her usual heroic stories about the likes of Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]. She instead speaks of the [[White Walkers]] and the coming of a vast winter that will blanket the world. When [[Robb Stark|Robb]] pays a visit, Bran asks his brother if it is true that his legs are crushed and that he will never walk again. Robb reluctantly says this is so. Bran remarks that he would rather be dead.\n\n[[File:Catelyn-arrive.png|thumb|Catelyn and Rodrik arrive in King's Landing.]][[Catelyn Stark]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] arrive at King's Landing and attempt to sneak into the city, but are spotted by one of Littlefinger's men. They are taken to meet Littlefinger at a brothel he owns, where Lord Varys is also waiting: one of his 'little birds' told him they were coming. Catelyn is angered by the way they've been treated, but asks Littlefinger for aid in finding the people who tried to have Bran killed. Littlefinger is able to answer this quickly: the elaborate dagger wielded by the assassin used to be his, but he lost it in a gamble with [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\n[[File:Eddard and Petyr 1x03.png|thumb|Eddard threatens Lord Baelish.]]Littlefinger fetches Eddard to meet his wife, but Eddard suspects a trick and pushes Littlefinger up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is. Catelyn then appears, and Eddard is pacified. After hearing her news, he vows to find the truth and expose the Lannisters to Robert. Littlefinger agrees to be his ally in this, for the affection he once bore Catelyn as a youngster.\n\nAt [[Castle Black]], the primary redoubt of the [[Night's Watch]] in the shadow of [[the Wall]], [[Jon Snow]] shows his worth to the trainer, Ser [[Alliser Thorne]], by besting several fellow members of the Watch in the practice yard. Thorne is disgusted at the poor performance of the others, but has no praise for Jon either, dubbing him Lord Snow, and describing him as &quot;the ''least useless person here&quot;''. Later on, several of the other recruits gang up on him, but the situation is defused by Tyrion. Tyrion points out to Jon that none of the other recruits had the benefit of a skilled master-at-arms to train them, and Jon is alienating them through his stand-offish attitude and superior combat skills.\n\n[[File:Jaime_&amp;_Cersei_1x03.png|thumb|Jaime comforts Cersei.]]\nRavens arrive at Castle Black and King's Landing with news of Bran's recovery. In the capital Cersei fears he will expose their secret, but Jaime comforts her. Elsewhere, Robert swaps old war stories with Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the [[Kingsguard]]. When Jaime Lannister appears, Robert jokingly questions him about Aerys Targaryen's death, wondering if the Mad King died begging for mercy, but Jaime rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he'd been saying since the siege of King's Landing began: &quot;Burn them all&quot;.\n\nAt Castle Black, Tyrion meets with [[Lord Commander]] [[Jeor\u00c2\u00a0Mormont]], the head of the Night's Watch, and his chief adviser, the ancient and blind Maester [[Aemon]]. Jeor asks for Tyrion to intercede at court and get the Watch more men, as they are dangerously under-strength. Aemon warns that the Stark words are right: a terrible winter is coming and more dangerous things than just [[Free Folk|wildlings]] might come with it; after all, one of their number swore that the White Walkers had returned... right up to the moment Ned Stark cut his head off. Tyrion admits his skepticism that supernatural creatures might exist, but agrees to bring word to his queen.\n\n[[File:Jon and Benjen 1x03.png|thumb|Benjen talks with Jon on the Wall.]]Later, [[Benjen Stark]] meets Jon atop the Wall and tells him he is going on a ranging in the [[Haunted Forest]]. He refuses to take Jon with him, telling him he isn't ready, and that here rank and nobility means nothing: every man must earn everything he gets. Before departing for King's Landing, Tyrion fulfills an old ambition by climbing to the top of the Wall and urinating off the edge of it. He and Jon share a moment of fellowship before he departs for the capital in the company of [[Yoren]], the recruiter for the Night's Watch who is also bound for King's Landing.\n\nIn King's Landing, Eddard has contracted a swordmaster, [[Syrio Forel]], the former [[First Sword of Braavos]], to teach Arya how to use her sword properly. Arya is thrilled, and [[Water Dance|'the dance']] begins. As Eddard watches them practice, his pleasure at seeing Arya happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the Starks and Lannisters may be inevitable; his daughter may well be training herself for war.\n\n===Across the [[Narrow Sea]]===\n[[File:Daenerys_1x03.png|thumb|Daenerys rides with the ''khalasar''.]]\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] commands the ''[[khalasar]]'' to halt on a whim, exercising her growing authority and power. [[Viserys]] does not take well to being commanded and threatens his sister. He is strangled by [[Rakharo]], a [[Dothraki]] warrior wielding a whip. Daenerys calms the situation and Viserys is forced to walk, a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding Dothraki. Later, Daenerys is told she is pregnant by [[Irri]]. She relays the news to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] and tells him she thinks it will be a boy as they lie naked in each others arms. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] and Rakharo compare the [[Westeros]]i and Dothraki ways of battle; of the heavily-armored but slow knights versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors. Jorah has heard of Rakharo's father, a great warrior, but admits that he disgraced [[Jeor Mormont|his own father]], a man of great honor. When he learns that Daenerys is pregnant, he announces he must split off from the column to ride to the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Qohor]], but will rejoin them before they reach [[Vaes Dothrak]].\n\n", "Production": "===Cast===\n{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Lord [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Mark Addy]] as King [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Emilia Clarke]] as Princess [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish]]\n* [[Harry Lloyd]] as Prince [[Viserys Targaryen]]\n* [[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Maisie Williams]] as [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as [[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Richard Madden]] as [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Jack Gleeson]] as Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n* and [[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n\n'''Also Starring'''\n*[[Jason Momoa]] as [[Khal Drogo]]\n{{Col-2}}\n\n'''Guest starring'''\n* [[Conleth Hill]] as [[Varys]]\n* [[James Cosmo]] as Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]]\n* [[Owen Teale]] as Ser [[Alliser Thorne]]\n* [[Jamie Sives]] as [[Jory Cassel]]\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Lord Commander [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Ron Donachie]] as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n* [[Joseph Mawle]] as [[Benjen Stark]]\n* [[Francis Magee]] as [[Yoren]]\n* [[Julian Glover]] as Grand Maester [[Pycelle]]\n* [[Gethin Anthony]] as Lord [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Maester [[Aemon]]\n* [[Miltos Yerolemou]] as [[Syrio Forel]]\n* [[Margaret John]] as [[Old Nan]]\n* [[Susan Brown]] as Septa [[Mordane]]\n* [[Robert Sterne]] as [[Royal Steward]]\n* [[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]]\n* [[Josef Altin]] as [[Pypar]]\n* [[Luke McEwan]] as [[Rast]]\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as [[Rakharo]]\n* [[Amrita Acharia]] as [[Irri]]\n* [[Eugene Simon]] as [[Lancel Lannister]]\n* [[Paul Portelli]] as a [[Drunk Man]]\n* [[Nickovich Sammut]] as [[Goldcloak 1 (Lord Snow)|Goldcloak 1]]\n* [[Seamus Kelly]] as [[Goldcloak 2 (Lord Snow)|Goldcloak 2]]\n* [[Emily Diamond]] as a [[King's Landing whore]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n* Starring cast members [[Alfie Allen]] ([[Theon Greyjoy]]) and [[Rory McCann]] ([[Sandor Clegane]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] makes his first appearance as [[Petyr Baelish]] and is added to the opening credits having being absent from the previous two episodes.\n* [[Richard Madden]] ([[Robb Stark]]) is credited after [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] ([[Bran Stark]]) in the opening sequence despite being credited before in the previous two episodes.\n* Casting associate [[Robert Sterne]] plays the [[Royal Steward]] who welcomes Eddard Stark to King's Landing.\n* [[Jason Momoa]] ([[Khal Drogo]]) is credited as 'also starring' during the closing credits of this episode.\n\n", "Notes": "* The episode takes its title from a mocking nickname given to Jon Snow by Ser [[Alliser Thorne]].\n* This episode is dedicated to the memory of [[Margaret John]], who plays Old Nan, who sadly passed away on 2 February 2011 after a brief illness.\n* During the Small Council scene, Renly hands Ned Stark a scroll containing the announcement of the tournament and the prizes for the winners, which he then reads off as &quot;40,000 [[Currency|Gold Dragons]] for the champion, 20,000 for the runner-up, and 20,000 for the best archer&quot;. Pycelle then asks if the crown can afford 80,000 Gold Dragons in prize money. If you pause when Ned first unrolls the scroll, its contents are actually clearly legible: it goes on to say that there is a 20,000 Gold Dragon prize for &quot;Combat with Swords and Clubs&quot;, which makes for a total tournament debt of 100,000 Gold Dragons. It is unclear why this discrepancy occurred.\n*The [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]] word that Irri is heard teaching Daenerys, &quot;''athjahakar''&quot;, is the Dothraki word for &quot;pride&quot;. It is derived from &quot;''jahak''&quot;, the long braid worn by Dothraki warriors which they take great pride in, as they only cut their braids when defeated.\n*When the [[Royal Steward]] greets Eddard Stark, and says that Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council, the steward mispronounces &quot;maester&quot; as &quot;my-stir&quot;; the correct pronunciation is actually &quot;may-stir&quot;. This was reportedly a common mistake on set which took the cast some time to get accustomed to.\n*When Joffrey complains to Cersei that every lord in the realm commanding his own soldiers raised from his feudal lands, he comments that he feels this is primitive, &quot;no better than the [[Hill tribes]].&quot; This is the first mention of the hill tribes of the [[Mountains of the Moon]] which ring [[the Vale of Arryn]], though they won't be encountered on-screen until two episodes after this, in &quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;.\n*Joffrey also mentions &quot;uncle Kevan&quot;: [[Kevan Lannister]] first appears on-screen five episodes from this in &quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;. Of course, Joffrey is speaking loosely, as Kevan is actually his mother's uncle, his great-uncle (it's common in real-life to refer to great-uncles as just &quot;uncle&quot;).\n*[[Old Nan]] offers to tell Bran a story about Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]. Duncan, also known as &quot;Dunk&quot;, is one of the main characters in the ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' prequel novellas, which being 89 years before the events of ''Game of Thrones'' (there are time skips between novellas in the series, and George R.R. Martin has said that he wants to continue them all the way up to the deaths of the characters, about 50 years before ''Game of Thrones''). Ser Duncan visited Winterfell in one of his adventures, and it is speculated that Old Nan met him in her youth.\n*The scene between Robert, Barristan, and Jaime, the scene between Tyrion, Yoren, and Benjen, and the scene between Jorah, Rakharo and Irri, were written at the last minute because the rough-cut of the episode was running short, and filmed in post-production re-shoots. Note that all of these scenes are interior shots which didn't need to be filmed on-location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&amp;A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\n*It is never revealed in the show who is the real owner of the dagger, and who sent the assassin to kill Bran.

This was not used in the final episode.\n* The argument between Arya and Sansa at the breakfast table was Sophie Turner's first scene filmed for the first season. Maisie Williams dented the table with the knife so badly it had to be rotated several times to hide the marks from the camera.\n* Mark Addy spooked one of the horses in the King's arrival scene in the first episode with his laugh, while he was talking to Bran.\n* Mark Addy's prosthetic beard was apparently easily removable so he could eat lunch without ruining it.\n* Eugene Simon taught Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner some magic tricks between takes.\n* Emilia Clarke was allowed to pick one of four horses for Daenerys's use in the series.\n* Harry Lloyd was responsible for introducing [[wikipedia:iPhone|iPhone]] game ''[[wikipedia:Fruit Ninja|Fruit Ninja]]'' to the cast. It went on to become a craze on set, with cast and crew competing to see who could get the highest score.\n* Joseph Mawle told Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner that if acting was easy, everyone would be doing it, so not to be worried if they found scenes hard because the producers had reasons for choosing them and they would be able to do the job.\n* The producers considered asking Miltos Yerolemou to shave his hair off to match the appearance of Syrio Forel in the books, but decided he looked better with his hair. Author George R.R.
