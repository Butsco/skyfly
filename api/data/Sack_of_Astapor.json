Strike the chains off of every slave you see!)|Daenerys Targaryen orders the Unsullied to purge Astapor of slavers.|And Now His Watch is Ended}}\nThe '''Sack of Astapor''' is an event in [[Slaver's Bay]] in which [[Daenerys Targaryen]] overthrows the [[Good Masters]] of [[Astapor]] and liberates all the slaves in the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe incident is orchestrated by Daenerys, who had previously been faced with the issue of using a slave army to conquer [[Seven Kingdoms|a realm]] in which slavery had been outlawed and reviled for centuries. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Having observed the suffering of Astapor's slaves &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, Daenerys devises a plan to acquire all of Astapor's [[Unsullied]] and turn on the Good Masters. She offers one of her dragons in exchange for the Unsullied, as her ship and gold weren't enough for the Good Masters. [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]] insults Daenerys repeatedly in his [[Low Valyrian|native tongue]]; Daenerys does not let on that she actually speaks the language fluently.\n\nDaenerys springs her trap after handing over [[Drogon]]. After making sure that the Unsullied are indeed loyal to her as their new master, she orders them to kill the Good Masters and their soldiers, as well as any man in Astapor who holds a whip. She also instructs them to spare all children and strike off the chains of any slave they came across.\n\nThe Good Masters are powerless to stop the situation, as the local defenders are not only outnumbered but also inferior to the Unsullied. Furthermore, [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]] had assumed that his new dragon would, like a slave, accept its new master. Daenerys reminds him that dragons are not slaves before commanding Drogon to burn the slaver as he frantically calls for his guards to kill her.\n\nThe Unsullied perform as promised, the Good Masters are all slain and the local slaves freed. Immediately after the Sack is completed Daenerys frees the Unsullied as well. They, however, opt ''en masse'' to continue their service to her as free men and depart Astapor with her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDaenerys leaves Astapor in the hands of a [[Astapori ruling council|council]] of former slaves to rule in her stead. However, the council is soon overthrown by a butcher named [[Cleon]] who seizes control of the city and styles himself as &quot;His Imperial Majesty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF|Fall of Astapor}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Sack of Astapor"}
