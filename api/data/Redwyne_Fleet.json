They wanted to, but during the early stages of the [[War of the Five Kings]] Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] holds the twin sons of Lord Paxter hostage at the royal court. After Renly dies, they join their Tyrell liege lords in aiding the Lannister army in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].\n\nThe practical result was that the Redwyne Fleet sat at anchor for much of the War of the Five Kings. It only became available to the Lannisters after the Battle of the Blackwater, but by that point Stannis's own navy was destroyed, and Robb Stark's threat was from land, not from the sea.\n\nThe addition of the Redwyne Fleet is a vital necessity to the Lannisters after the Battle of the Blackwater, during which most of the original [[Royal Fleet]] was functionally destroyed. Cersei worries, however, that this makes them even more reliant upon the Tyrells and their vassals from the Reach.\n\nThe Lannisters consider Stannis to be a bigger threat than the [[ironborn]], so they begin to move the Redwyne Fleet east to blockade Stannis's remaining forces at [[Storm's End]] and [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. It takes some months to move the fleet, however, and they are in no dire hurry because Stannis is in no position to attack.\n\n", "History": "\nHad [[Brynden Tully]] married [[Bethany Redwyne]] as his brother, Lord [[Hoster Tully]], intended, by the time of [[Robert's Rebellion]], the rebels would've counted with the Redwyne fleet to aid them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nYears later, the Redwyne Fleet took part in the [[Siege of Storm's End]], preventing any supply from reaching the [[Storm's End|castle]] by sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert's Rebellion (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Redwyne Fleet"}
