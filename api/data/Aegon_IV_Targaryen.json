Inevitably the greatest of these, Daemon Blackfyre, declared himself the rightful heir, and ignited yet another war for the crown.|[[Varys]]|The Death of Kings}}\n'''Aegon IV Targaryen''', also called '''Aegon the Unworthy''', is an unseen character in ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''. He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it begins.\n\nAegon IV was the fourth king of his name to sit on the [[Iron Throne]] and the eleventh king of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty to rule the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He was an ancestor of [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. He was formally styled '''Aegon of House Targaryen, the Fourth of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm'''.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aegon IV is remembered as one of the worst kings in the entire history of the Targaryen dynasty, which is the reason why he is popularly known as &quot;Aegon the Unworthy&quot;. He was a decadent ruler and glutton, who indulged his passions and whims at every opportunity. Being attractive in his youth, he was popular with women both highborn and lowborn. He had as many as nine mistresses and many bastards. Supposedly, he had any woman he wanted whether they were married or not. People often joked that while the Targaryen words were &quot;Fire and Blood&quot;, Aegon IV's motto might as well have been &quot;Wash her and bring her to my bed&quot;. Due to his years of overindulgence, by the end of his reign Aegon IV was extremely obese, to the point that his legs could barely support his own weight. Even so he remained quite vain throughout his life. Moreover, he was a very petty man, needlessly causing strife at the royal court.\n\nFour of his bastard children were born to noblewomen, and they became known as the &quot;[[Great Bastards]]&quot;. Chief among them was Daemon, who upon being legitimized created House Blackfyre. Other notable bastards were Aegor\u00c2\u00a0Rivers (&quot;Bittersteel&quot;),\u00c2\u00a0Brynden\u00c2\u00a0Rivers (&quot;Bloodraven&quot;) and Shiera Seastar.\u00c2\u00a0Aegon IV foolishly [[Legitimization|legitimized]] all of his bastard children upon his deathbed, which resulted in Daemon Blackfyre declaring himself the rightful heir and tearing apart the Seven Kingdoms in civil war. Ultimately, Aegon IV's corruption led to a series of [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]s which would plague Westeros for five generations.\n\nAccording to author [[George R.R. Martin]], Aegon IV is loosely the Targaryen equivalent of King [[wikipedia:Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII of England]]. Martin's instructions for artistic depictions of Aegon IV explicitly cite Henry VIII. Both kings started out young and attractive, but by the ends of their reigns became infamously fat from overindulgence, and their numerous sexual affairs resulted in bloody succession conflicts which were eventually resolved with the rise of good rulers (Daeron II and Elizabeth I respectively).\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|The ''Lives of Four Kings''.
