The 'demon road' from [[Volantis]] runs along its northern shore, but the road is considered cursed and few dare to use its perils to reach [[Slaver's Bay]] to the east, most preferring the sea route south around Valyria itself.\n\nIt is not known if the Sea of Sighs existed before the Doom of Valyria, or was created during the volcanic tumults of that event. The latter seems more likely, as the map collection ''The Lands of Ice and Fire''\u00c2\u00a0reveals that the Sea of Sighs appears to be colored blood-red, suggesting an ominous history.\n\n"}, "title": "The Sea of Sighs"}
