It dominates the skyline of the city, and serves as the city's primary fortress and redoubt.\n\nLocated in the southeastern corner of King's Landing, the Red Keep overlooks [[Blackwater Bay]] and the [[Narrow Sea]]. It is currently the seat of King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen&amp;nbsp;Baratheon]], and was formerly the seat of King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], King [[Robert Baratheon]],\u00c2\u00a0and before him the seat of the [[Targaryen]] kings.\n\n", "In the books": "In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', the Red Keep is a major castle complex located at the south-eastern corner of the city of King's Landing, directly overlooking the [[Blackwater Rush]] and [[Blackwater Bay]]. It is built atop Aegon's High Hill, the tallest hill of the city, and affords a panoramic view of the rest of the city. It consists of a number of interconnected buildings, such as the main keep, a secondary castle called Maegor's Holdfast and the Tower of the Hand, the seat of the [[Hand of the King]]. White Sword Tower is the base of operations for the [[Kingsguard]]. The Red Keep is so-named due to the redstone bricks used to build it.\n\nThe Red Keep was built approximately three centuries prior to the events of the series and replaced an earlier wooden fort called &quot;Aegonfort&quot;, built by King [[Aegon I Targaryen]] where he first set foot on the continent and used as his base of operations in his conquest of Westeros. After Aegon deemed the fort unsuitable for rule, he took the royal court to [[Dragonstone (castle)|Dragonstone]], and ruled there for many years until his death. The construction of the Keep was an immense undertaking, spanning the reign of the first few [[Targaryen]] kings, although modifications and additions to the castle have been made ever since.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "Production Designer [[Gemma Jackson]] said that the look of the floor in the Red Keep is based on the Pantheon in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/04/04/game-of-thrones-10-secrets-about-hbos-adaptation-of-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-by-george-rr-martin.html Gemma Jackson in The Daily Beast]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nKing's Landing.jpg|The Red Keep overlooking King's Landing, as seen from the north\nTyrion and Varys.jpg|The south side of the Red Keep, seen from the sea wall close to the mouth of the Blackwater Rush.\nRedKeepFront.jpg|Frontal aerial view of the Red Keep\nGreatSeptExteriors.jpg|The Red Keep seen in the distance, from the western side of King's Landing\nKimberly Pope Red Keep Concept Art I.jpg|Concept art of the Red Keep's vaults\nDragon Skull Cave.jpg|One of the Red Keep's underground vaults, where the skulls of Targaryen dragons were dumped after Robert's Rebellion\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Specific Locations": "\n===The Great Hall===\n\nThe Great Hall is the [[Great Hall (Red Keep)|massive throne room]] of the Red Keep and where the [[Iron Throne]] stands. The King (or his Hand, in the event of the King's absence), holds court and receives petitioners within the Great Hall. It is also employed for official ceremonies.\n\n===Maegor's Holdfast===\n\n[[Maegor's Holdfast]] is a stout tower in the center of the Red Keep. It was named after King [[Maegor Targaryen]], who built the Red Keep. It serves as a redoubt when the city is attacked. The royal apartments are also located in Maegor's Holdfast.\n\nMaegor's Holdfast served as a refuge for Queen Cersei\u00c2\u00a0and the highborn ladies of the Red Keep during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].\n\n===The Tower of the Hand===\n\nThe [[Tower of the Hand]] is the location of the quarters and offices of the [[Hand of the King]]. The Hand's family, household and guards also live and work in the Tower of the Hand.\n\nWhen [[Tywin Lannister]] assumes his Hand duties for King [[Joffrey]] he arranges for the meetings of the small council to be held in the Tower of the Hand to assert his own authority.\n\n===The White Sword Tower===\nThe [[White Sword Tower]] houses the chambers of the [[Kingsguard]].\n\n===The Maidenvault===\n\nThe [[Maidenvault]] was built under orders of King [[Baelor Targaryen]] to imprison his sisters [[Daena Targaryen|Daena]], [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]], and [[Elaena Targaryen|Elaena]] to prevent them from inciting any carnal thought in the pious king.\n\n===The Godswood===\n\nThe Red Keep's [[Godswood]] overlooks the [[Blackwater Rush]]. It has no [[weirwood]] as the Red Keep is not an ancient castle from the time the [[Old Gods of the Forest]] held sway south of [[the Neck]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Traitor's Walk===\n\nThe Traitor's Walk is an outer corridor on one of the sides of the Red Keep with view to one of its outer walls. The heads of criminals and traitors are placed on spikes over said wall, visible both to the exterior of the Red Keep and whoever passes through the corridor.\n\nFollowing the arrest and execution of [[Ned Stark]], his head and those of his entire household were placed on the wall beside the Traitor's Walk.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The dungeons===\n\nThe dungeons of the Red Keep are divided in four levels:\n\n* On the upper level are cells with high narrow windows where common criminals are confined together.\n\n*The second level has smaller, personal cells without windows for highborn captives and valuable [[hostage]]s.\n\n* The [[Black Cells]] are the third level. Prisoners accused of treason and other high crimes are kept within the Black Cells, as was the case of Ned Stark. [[Varys]] has access to the Black Cells, though he dons the disguise of a gaoler when entering.\n\n*The fourth level is spoken of only in rumors. Once a man is taken here, he never sees the light of day again and is subjected to the most painful torments.\n\n===Secret passages===\n\nThe Red Keep, according to rumors, is full of miles of secret passages running behind the walls and below the floors. Maegor the Cruel had the builders of the Red Keep executed after the castle was completed to keep the secret of the passageways.\n\n"}, "title": "Red Keep"}
