Because the [[Harlaw|island of Harlaw]] is the wealthiest of the Iron Islands, House Harlaw is one of the few ironborn families that approach the Greyjoys in strength and influence. She\u00c2\u00a0has an\u00c2\u00a0older\u00c2\u00a0sister\u00c2\u00a0Gwynesse, who was widowed by the Greyjoy Rebellion, and a younger brother Lord\u00c2\u00a0Rodrik Harlaw\u00c2\u00a0known as Rodrik the Reader. Her brother refers\u00c2\u00a0to her by\u00c2\u00a0the pet name &quot;Lanny.&quot;\n\nAlannys was devastated by Theon being taken hostage and the deaths of her two eldest sons in the Greyjoy Rebellion, and began wandering the halls at night shrieking out their names. She had five ironborn\u00c2\u00a0boys brought to be fostered at Pyke after\u00c2\u00a0Ned Stark brought Theon to Winterfell including Tristifer Botley, a childhood love of Asha's.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWhen her\u00c2\u00a0psychosis worsened, she left\u00c2\u00a0Pyke to retire to the [[Ten Towers]], her family's seat on the island of Harlaw. Thus she is not present at Pyke when Theon returns to see his father. Asha briefly visits her mother before leaving to conquer Deepwood Motte in her part in Balon's invasion of the North. During the visit Alannys constantly asks about Theon who she thinks of as perpetually ten years old, his age when he was taken hostage. Asha feels she no longer knows her mother though she is kind to her and answers her questions patiently. When Asha returns to the Iron Islands, she cannot bring herself to tell her mother Theon is dead (as Asha incorrectly presumes). Asha meets Tristifer Botley at Ten Towers who informs her that\u00c2\u00a0he still only loves Asha.\u00c2\u00a0He has asked and received Alannys's consent to marry Asha though Asha rejects the proposal.\n\nAlannys has long white hair. She &quot;never had the sort of beauty the singers cherished, but her daughter had loved her fierce strong face and the laughter in her eyes&quot;, although Asha now finds Alannys's eyes dim and cloudy.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nAlannys Greyjoy was born into [[House Harlaw]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Greyjoy entry]&lt;/ref&gt; and married [[Balon Greyjoy]], head of [[House Greyjoy]] and the [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].
