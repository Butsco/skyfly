Rather, a stunt man in a green-screen suit stood in for the bear on-set in Northern Ireland so the actors would have the proper eye-line, while the actor-bear was filmed in his sanctuary in Los Angeles, and his trainer walked him through the required motions for the scene. The actor-bear's footage was then digitally integrated into the shots with the human actors.\n\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nBear and maiden fair promo brienne a.png\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n"}, "title": "Bart the Bear"}
