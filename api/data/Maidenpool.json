It is linked to King's Landing by two roads, one that runs along the coast of [[Crackclaw Point]] to the east and another that passes directly south through [[Duskendale]] in the Crownlands. Fisherfolk northwest of Maidenpool fish the waters in leather coracles and collect clams. Maidenpool's main gate is called the Fool's Gate.\n\nMaidenpool is sacked during the [[War of the Five Kings]]. [[Jaime]], [[Alton Lannister#In the books|Cleos Frey]] and [[Brienne]] pass through the town on their way to King's Landing, noticing that the town walls are deserted, the gates are smashed, and half the homes and shops are burned or plundered. After the Battle of Duskendale, [[Randyll Tarly]] marches on Maidenpool, takes the town and locks Lord William Mooton in a tower cell. Later he begins to rebuild the town while hunting the outlaws in the area.\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nMaidenpool is famed in song as the location where the foolish knight [[Florian]] met and fell in love with [[Jonquil]].
