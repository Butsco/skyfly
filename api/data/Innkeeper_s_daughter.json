She is played by [[Gabrielle Dempsey]] and only appears in &quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no direct parallel to this character. This girl's story is more similar to a story Arya hears Chiswyck, one of the Mountain's men, telling at [[Harrenhal]]. He recalls that after the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]] Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and his men gang raped Layna, the daughter of the keeper of an inn on the [[Goldroad]]. Layna resisted but she had no chance against the Mountain and his men. When the girl's brother tried to intervene, he was killed by Rafford. Chiswyck estimates her to have been eighteen at the time of the rape, but Rafford corrects him by stating that she was only thirteen. The men find this hilarious, which angers Arya and influences her to name Chiswyck as the first to be killed by [[Jaqen H'ghar]].\n\nWhen Arya and the Hound enter the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], they encounter Polliver, the [[Tickler]] and a squire. Polliver sits with a girl in his lap, but she does not resist; no one else touches her; and there is no mentioning she is related to the innkeeper. Polliver shoves her away and stands to talk with the Hound. When the situation gets tense and it is clear that a brawl is imminent, the girl and the other locals leave the inn.\n\n", "Biography": "===[[Season 4]]===\nWhen [[Arya Stark]] and [[Sandor Clegane]] arrive at an inn, the [[innkeeper]] is begging [[Polliver]] to stop his men from raping his daughter. [[Polliver]] tells him to shut up and pour them more ale, or they may take her with them when they are done with her. She escapes upstairs when the fighting breaks out between the Hound and the [[Lannister soldier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF|Layna}}\n\n"}, "title": "Innkeeper's daughter"}
