He is best known for his appearance in the short-lived 2009 series ''[[wikipedia:Hope Springs|Hope Springs]]'' and his role as real-life musician [[wikipedia:Kirk Brandon|Kirk Brandon]] in ''[[wikipedia:Worried About the Boy|Worried About the Boy]]'', a dramatisation of the life of [[wikipedia:Boy George|Boy George]]. In 2011 he had a leading role in the British comedy-drama series ''[[wikipedia:Sirens (UK TV series)|Sirens]]'', playing gay paramedic Ashley Greenwick. In 2012 he appeared in the BBC adaptation of ''[[wikipedia:Birdsong (TV serial)|Birdsong]]'' as World War I officer Captain Weir. His most recent role is as Prince Charming in the live-action adaptation of Disney's ''[[wikipedia:Cinderella (2015 film)|Cinderella]]''.\n\nHe stars in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Robb Stark]]. He was announced in the role on 20 August 2009. During filming of the pilot he won the &quot;Best-Dressed Man in Scotland 2009&quot; Award, but was unable to attend the ceremony due to his workload. He was part of the initial starring cast and remains a member of the starring cast for the [[Season 2|second]] and [[Season 3|third seasons]].\n\nMadden intentionally only read the novels that corresponded to the current season, i.e. he only read the second novel after Season 1 ended, to prepare for Season 2. Madden was aware from the very beginning, however, that Robb Stark dies in the third novel, because other people spoiled it for him very early on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/game-of-thrones-q-a-richard-madden-on-robb-starks-endgame-20130602 Rolling Stone]&lt;/ref&gt;\n", "See also": "*{{WP}}\n*{{IMDb\n|# = 0534635}}\n*{{Twitter\n|# = _richardmadden}}\n*{{Instagram|# = maddenrichard}}\n\n"}, "title": "Richard Madden"}
