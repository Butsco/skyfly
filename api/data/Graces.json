Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.|[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]|The Laws of Gods and Men}}\n'''Graces''' are priestesses in the Ghiscari religion of [[Slaver's Bay]].  The center of worship in each major city is known as the [[Temple of the Graces]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Graces are divided into sub-orders, who wear different colored robes to denote their function.  For example, the Blue Graces wear blue robes, and their specialty is healing.  The Graces are apparently an all-female clergy.  Many of the Graces are of noble birth, though it is unclear if this is an absolute requirement, or if this varies from one suborder to the next.\n\nThe Blue Graces are skilled healers and surgeons, treating everything from plague to serious battle injuries from sword and arrow (in this respect they are somewhat like the Order of [[Maesters]] in Westeros).  \n\nThe Red Graces are [[Wikipedia:Sacred prostitution|cult prostitutes]].  They are the only Graces that are allowed to have sex, while the others are sworn to chastity.  \n\nThe White Graces are young girls of noble birth to young to serve in [[Pleasure house|pleasure houses]].  While not stated, they apparently join other suborders of Graces when they grow older.  \n\nThe Green Grace is the high priestess, and there is apparently only one at a time in any given temple.  The Green Grace is attended upon by the Pink Graces - they may have no other function than to serve as personal attendants to the Green Grace.  \n\nGold Graces and Purple Graces also exist, but their specific functions have not been mentioned.  \n\n"}, "title": "Graces"}
