It is narrated by [[Jack Gleeson]] as [[Joffrey Baratheon]].\n\n", "Synopsis": "[[Joffrey Baratheon]] describes the [[Red Keep]] and the various methods of torture that it has housed throughout its history.\n\n", "Summary": "''\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;''&quot;Mine&quot; is what Joffrey calls the [[Red Keep]]. The [[smallfolk]] say that it's\u00c2\u00a0color comes from the blood [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] spilt to win his crown. Joffrey chuckles and call them fools. Blood doesn't soak into stone, no matter how hard he tries.\n\nAegon built the castle of red rock to remind people of the fires he had roasted his enemies in, so whenever [[King's Landing]] looked up, they would\u00c2\u00a0see the price of defiance. He knew the first rule of kings: only fear keeps men in line. Fear and punishment, a lesson he taught his son [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]]. When the builders finally finished the Red Keep, Maegor executed them all to keep it's secrets safe. Rumor has it miles of hidden passageways run behind the walls and under the floors. One day Joffrey will have to find them.\n\nTraitors and women work in shadows. A king has no need for secrecy. Now people name Maegor &quot;the Cruel&quot;, but Joffrey doubts any did in his day. His strength was all too rare in the degenerate Targaryen blood. The simpering [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor]] &quot;the Blessed&quot; created the [[Maidenvault]] to imprison [[Daena Targaryen|his]] [[Rhaena Targaryen|own]] [[Elaena Targaryen|sisters]] and save himself from carnal thoughts. Joffrey finds this disgusting, though he admits a Princevault could be amusing when [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] bores him.\n\nJoffrey's favorite place in the Red Keep? There are so many. The Traitors' Walk where he mounts the heads of his enemies comes to mind. He laments that flesh rots so slowly, as he has almost run out of spikes. The dungeons are also quite nice once you get past the first two levels, which are a stable for common criminals and private cells for useful highborns. How boring, he knows. But then you comes to the [[Black Cells]]. No windows, no torches, just darkness and whatever you hear in there with you. Here they keep the greatest traitors until the king is ready for them, and with these he often likes to take his time.\n\nBut he has heard rumors of an even lower hidden level, Maegor's favorite. Once a man was taken there, he never saw the sun again nor heard a human voice, nor breathed a breath free of agonising pain. [[Varys]] must know the way, but that overgrown girl pretends not to. Maybe he fears Joffrey will make him a victim. Maybe he will...\n\nThen again, torture chambers are just so...private. Better to punish your enemies where everyone can see and remember. Like [[Aegon II Targaryen|that Targaryen]] who forced [[Aegon III Targaryen|his nephew]] to watch as he fed the boy's [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|traitor mother]] to a [[Sunfyre|dragon]]. Oh, what Joffrey could do with a dragon...\n\nEven [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]], fool as he was, knew to burn men alive with an audience to spread the terror far and wide across his kingdoms. Of course, Joffrey knows his favorite place now! When he sits on the [[Iron Throne]] high in the Red Keep. All of [[Westeros]] scuttles below him like insects waiting for his heel to land.\n\n"}, "title": "The Red Keep (Histories &amp; Lore)"}
