The two novels take place concurrently, with the fourth novel detailing events in the Seven Kingdoms, while the fifth novel follows events outside of them (at the Wall, Arya and Tyrion in the Free Cities, and Daenerys in Slaver's Bay). Originally the fourth and fifth novel were going to be one very long novel, but Martin had to split them apart because it had grown too large. The TV series chose to simply intercut material from the two - which, in a sense, is recreating the original effect that Martin intended.\n\n==[[The Wars to Come]]==\n\n==[[The House of Black and White]]==\n\n==[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]==\n\n==[[The Sons of the Harpy]]==\n\n==[[Kill the Boy]]==\n\n==[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]==\n\n==[[The Gift]]==\n\n"}, "title": "Differences between books and TV series - Season 5"}
