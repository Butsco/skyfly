Some such as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] actually have three separate wigs on-call at any time (because her wig is white and gets dirty easily). Some of the wigs for main cast members can cost as much as $7,000 each (the longer ones cost more). The wigs are made of real human hair, sourced from India, Europe, and Russia. [[Cersei Lannister]]'s wig, in particular, does not undergo any chemical processing at all: the wig maker sourced individual colors and strands of hair, which were then individually knotted onto a lace cap for her golden blonde blend. Other actors such as [[Kit Harington]] ([[Jon Snow]]) and [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark]]) do not wear wigs, but have their hair dyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{Imdb name|0018552|Kevin Alexander}}\n\n"}, "title": "Kevin Alexander"}
