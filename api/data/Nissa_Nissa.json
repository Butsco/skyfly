To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and a hundred nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWhen [[Davos Seaworth]] hears the story, he marvels at the thought of such true sword of fire. But then he thinks of his beloved wife [[Marya Seaworth|Marya]] and decides that if this is the price of a magic sword - it is more than he cares to pay.\n\n"}, "title": "Nissa Nissa"}
