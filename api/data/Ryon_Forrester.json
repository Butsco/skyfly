Someone did something bad to Father and Rodrik. Someone should hurt them even worse.|Ryon to Ethan Forrester|Iron From Ice}}\n\n'''Ryon Forrester''' is the fourth-born son of Lord [[Gregor Forrester]] and his lady wife, [[Elissa Forrester]].\n", "Family Tree": "{{House Forrester family tree}}\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Telltale Game Series Appearances|yes|yes}}\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nThe last of the Forrester children, Ryon grew up idolizing his elder siblings and spent many an hour chasing\u00c2\u00a0[[Ethan Forrester|Ethan]] and [[Talia Forrester|Talia]] through the grove. His youth has been pleasant and shielded from responsibility - but recently Ryon's innocence has begun to fade. When the war began, Ryon was too young to understand why [[Rodrik Forrester|Rodrik]] and his father were leaving home. But the grim realities of a House at war have been impossible to avoid and Ryon now asks questions for which his siblings have no answers.\n===&quot;[[Iron From Ice]]&quot;===\nRyon first appears in the forest just outside [[Ironrath]] playing hide and seek with his newly appointed lord brother Ethan Forrester and his sister Talia. Ryon cannot find Ethan and gets scared, having just lost his father and eldest brother, he fears he will lose Ethan too.\n\nLater, at Ironrath, Ryon is seen carving a wooden sword, which one day he hopes will be a real sword so he can kill the people who destroyed his family. Etched into the sword are the names of two of his brothers, Ethan, for strength, and Rodrik, to remember him. He names the sword Two Brothers. Ethan notices the lack of his other brother's name [[Asher Forrester|Asher]].\n\nRyon is present when [[Ramsay Snow]] is invited into the hall at Ironrath and is shown to be very scared of Ramsay. After Ramsay murders Ethan, he orders that Ryon become a ward of [[House Whitehill]], effectively making the new heir a hostage.\n\n===&quot;[[The Lost Lords]]&quot;===\nRyon remains a ward at [[Highpoint]] until his father and brother Ethan's funeral. Rodrik either decides to submit to [[Ludd Whitehill|Lord Whitehill]] and kiss his ring in order to allow Ryon to attend, or refuses to be cowed by the rival lord. If Rodrik submits, Ryon attends the funeral with an escort of four Whitehill soldiers. Ryon begs his brother to return him to Ironrath, and Rodrik\u00c2\u00a0promises that his family will not forget him. If Rodrik\u00c2\u00a0stands up to Lord Whitehill, Ryon is instead kept at Highpoint during the funeral. However,\u00c2\u00a0[[Gwyn Whitehill]] is sent in his place and assures Rodrik that he is fine, but scared, as [[Ludd Whitehill]] tells him daily that his family has forgotten him and that his father and brother died because they were traitors and cowards. Rodrik asks Gwyn to make sure he does not believe the lies told to him by Lord Whitehill.\n\n"}, "title": "Ryon Forrester"}
