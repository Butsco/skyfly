The rival faction at court who supported her stepmother [[Alicent Hightower]] and her children spread the accusation that Rhaenyra's three sons were not really Laenor's, but [[Bastardy|bastards]] fathered by Harwin Strong. In an effort to confirm that he considered Rhaenyra and her sons the true heirs to the throne, her father King [[Viserys II Targaryen|Viserys II]] decreed that a dragon egg would be put in the cradle of each of the boys, to bond with the dragons that hatched from them. Those who doubted the paternity of Rhaenyra's sons also doubted that the eggs would ever hatch, but they were quickly disappointed, as each of the eggs soon hatched in turn. The hatchlings were named Vermax (bonded with Jacaerys), Arrax (bonded with Lucerys), and Tyraxes (bonded with Joffrey). The exact date each hatched is not known but the last seems to have hatched by no later than about 120 AC.\n\nAt the start of the civil war Prince Jacaerys flew north as a messenger on Vermax. Tyraxes retreated into his lair roasting every would-be dragon slayer as they rushed after him. His entrance was made impassable by the corpses. The mob entered a back entrance instead. The dragon's chain entangled Tyraxes as he turned and was slain. Half a dozen men and one woman claimed to have dealt the death blow.\n\n", "Biography": "During the [[Dance of the Dragons]], an angry mob of [[smallfolk]] [[Storming of the Dragonpit|stormed]] the [[Dragonpit]] where [[House Targaryen]] stabled their [[Dragons|dragons]].
