He and his sister were the children of Lord [[Tytos Lannister]]'s younger brother. Thus, both Joanna and Stafford were first cousins of Tywin and the main branch of the family.\n\nIn his youth, Stafford and two more Lannisters were captured by Lady Tarbeck in retaliation for the imprisonment of her lord husband by [[Tytos Lannister]]. She threatened to kill the captives if her husband would be harmed. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] suggested his father to send Lord Tarbeck back to his wife in three pieces, but the soft-hearted Tytos complied and returned Tarbeck unharmed in exchange for the three Lannisters.\n\nStafford dies in the Battle of Oxcross, killed by Lord [[Rickard Karstark]]. Both [[Jaime Lannister]] and [[Brynden Tully]] consider him a poor commander as he didn't scout the area believing Robb Stark was far away.
