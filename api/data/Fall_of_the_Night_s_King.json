After his fall, when it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the [[White Walkers|Others]] (possibly in a similar way to [[Craster]]), all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Night's King, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along [[the Wall]] should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of the Night's King also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not &quot;rule&quot; the Wall but who serve the realms of men.\n\n", "History": "===Prelude===\n[[File:NightsKingQueen.jpg|thumb|left|The Night's King and the Night's Queen enslaved the black brothers and performed human sacrifices.]]The thirteenth [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Night's Watch]] found in the [[Haunted Forest]] a [[Night's Queen|cold woman]] with bright blue eyes, seemingly a female [[White Walker]].
