Reasons range from birth defects to injuries sustained during childhood. A more polite term to refer to them is '''simple'''.\n\n[[Smallfolk|Lowborn]] lackwits often find themselves in menial positions of servitude. Meanwhile, lackwits that belong to [[noble house]]s remain under the care of their families and may be employed in [[marriage]] alliances - considered poor matches, obviously - but remain the subject of mockery and shame.\n\n"}, "title": "Lackwit"}
