However, there are numerous sellsword companies operating across the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay, many more than have been described or mentioned by name, so a group like the Lost Legion could quite plausibly exist in the background.\n\nPeople of Valyrian descent, such as the Targaryens, have purple-colored irises in the novels.  The TV series was going to do this using colored eye contact lenses but quickly abandoned it:  noting that &quot;actors act with their eyes&quot; it was felt that the contact lenses were too distracting, and affecting actors' performances.  The video game developers felt no such restrictions, given that the physical appearance of characters is separated from their voice actors, so they did give many of the Lost Legion members purple irises.\n\n"}, "title": "Lost Legion"}
