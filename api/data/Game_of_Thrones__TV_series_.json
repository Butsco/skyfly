From left to right [[Kit Harington]], [[Emilia Clarke]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] and [[Peter Dinklage]].]]\nSee the [[production timeline]] for a more detailed history of the show's development and production.\n\nDavid Benioff was sent a collection of the first four novels in the series (''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', ''A Storm of Swords'' and ''A Feast for Crows'') by George R.R. Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n\nHBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the [[wikipedia:2007\u00e2&euro;&ldquo;2008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007\u00e2&euro;&ldquo;2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with [[Peter Dinklage]] the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n\nHBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of [[Season 1]] began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n\nProduction of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as [[direwolves]] and [[dragons]]. The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only ''[[wikipedia:The Sopranos|The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:True Blood|True Blood]]''. In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n\nProduction of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode ''[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]'' won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted ''True Blood'' as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and ''The Sopranos'' as its most successful series worldwide.\n\nProduction of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n\nTwo further seasons have been commissioned,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-renewed-two-more-694544 The Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; taking the show up to a sixth year.\n\n==Future seasons, and catching up with the books==\n===The initial plan===\nIt is generally projected that the TV series will last seven or eight seasons, but no one is entirely sure.\n\nAs of 2014, five books have been published in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n\nThe third novel, ''A Storm of Swords'', was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out. Because the third novel was so long, the production team realized it would be impossible to condense it all into a single season, so the decision was made to adapt its contents across two seasons. While [[Season 3]] ends with the [[Red Wedding]], this actually happened in the ''middle'' of the third novel (similar to how [[Renly Baratheon]] suddenly died in the middle of [[Season 2]]). [[Jon Snow]] returned to [[Castle Black]] by the middle of the third novel. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] had not yet reached [[Meereen]] by the middle of the third novel. A few characters did advance further than this in Season 3, i.e. [[Bran Stark]] actually passed north of the Wall at the end of the third novel (he had so few chapters in the entire book that the TV producers didn't want to space it out for two full seasons).\n\nAs a result, while there are projected to be seven novels, splitting the third novel into two seasons should mean that the TV series will end with Season 8. Even so the producers have never been sure about this, and often simply gave the figure of &quot;seven or eight&quot; seasons.\n\n===Seasons 5: Intercutting the fourth and fifth novels===\n\nWhat was originally planned as the fourth novel was even longer than the third novel, so Martin split it into two novels: ''A Feast for Crows'' (the fourth book) and ''A Dance with Dragons'' (the fifth book). The fourth and fifth books occur during a simultaneous timeframe: all of the chapters set in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] were moved to the fourth book, while all chapters set outside of the Seven Kingdoms (at [[the Wall]] or across the [[Narrow Sea]] in [[Essos]]) were moved to the fifth book. Though of course, despite splitting them because as one book they would have been longer than the third novel, Martin kept making additions to the fourth and fifth novels during the writing process, so both are nearly as long as the third novel.\n\nIt would be odd to spend an entire season with one set of characters while the rest do not appear, then reverse this in the subsequent season. So the TV series's plan is that Seasons 5 will chronologically present events in the order that they happened. This is comparable to how J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Two Towers'' actually consisted of two halves: the first half entirely follows Aragorn since the end of the first novel, then the second half backs up in time to follow only Frodo's perspective, but during the same timeframe since the end of the first novel. Peter Jackson's movie adaptation, however, chose to simply intercut between the two storylines to show events in the chronological order in which they occurred. Thus &quot;Season 5&quot; will consist of the majority of the material from\u00c2\u00a0''A Feast for Crows'' and ''A Dance with Dragons.''\n\n===Future of the show: How many seasons?===\n\nGiven that there are currently five novels (with the third split into two seasons), but given the fact that the majority of the last two novels will be adapted in season 5,\u00c2\u00a0there is currently only enough print material to adapt through the end of Season 5 (for most storylines). Even so, Martin has told producers Benioff &amp; Weiss the general outline of how the final two books are going to progress (so if a bolt of lightning strikes Martin, they'd still be able to finish according to Martin's general plan).\n\nDuring [[Season 3]], in an interview with ''Mother Jones'' magazine, Benioff &amp; Weiss said that they thought the TV series might run as many as eight seasons, for a total of 80 episodes, though they were unsure:\n\n:Mother Jones: &quot;So I gather that Game of Thrones could last eight or nine seasons. Does that mean putting novel writing on hold for a decade?\n:Benioff &amp; Weiss: &quot;Yes, if we live that long and HBO keeps wanting to make the show. '''We have the opportunity here to tell a coherent story that lasts for 80 hours.''' And while a canvas of that size presents all sorts of storytelling problems, it also allows us to spend more time with these characters we love than we'll ever get again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/03/hbo-game-thrones-season-3-interview-david-benioff-dan-weiss Benioff &amp; Weiss ''Mother Jones'' interview.]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSoon before [[Season 4]] began, however, in early March 2014 executive producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss made several comments that they actually felt Season 4 was the &quot;midway point&quot; of the TV series, which would probably last ''seven seasons''. On March 11, 2014, they said in ''Entertainment Weekly'':\n\n:&quot;It feels like this is the midpoint for us...If we\u00e2&euro;&trade;re going to go seven seasons, which is the plan, Season 4 is right down the middle, the pivot point...I would say it's the goal we've had from the beginning...It was our unstated goal, because to start on a show and say your goal is seven seasons is the height of lunacy. Once we got to the point where we felt like we're going to be able to tell this tale to its conclusion, that became [an even clearer] goal. Seven gods, seven kingdoms, seven seasons. It feels right to us.\u00e2&euro;?&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/03/11/game-of-thrones-7-seasons/ Entertainment Weekly], March 11th, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe repeated statements Benioff and Weiss made throughout Season 4 that they &quot;always&quot; intended for there to be seven seasons simply contradict previous statements they made in formal print interviews, such as with ''Mother Jones'' in 2013 (though plans can and do change over many years).\n\nBenioff &amp; Weiss, as well as George R.R. Martin himself, then provided comments for the April 2014 issue of ''Vanity Fair'' (which was released about two weeks after Benioff and Weiss said in ''Entertainment Weekly'' that there might be only seven seasons). Contradicting his statements made at the same time in ''EW'' that &quot;we're going for seven seasons, it's been our goal since the beginning&quot;, Benioff instead repeated that the production team wasn't sure if the TV series would last &quot;seven or eight&quot; seasons.\n\n:&quot;If we're a series and we're four seasons, five seasons in, and it's indefinite as to how long it's gonna go, then I don't think there\u00e2&euro;&trade;s as much pressure as far as, the end is coming, the end is nigh. So, for us, whether it ends up being seven or eight, it's right around there. I think we've always felt \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; we just completed the fourth season \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; this is the midpoint. And we're coming around the bend right now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/03/benioff-and-weiss-on-planning-for-the-end-were-coming-around-the-bend-right-now/ Vanity Fair], April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nElio and Linda of Westeros.org analyzed these conflicting statements before Season 5 began, and offered an explanation: most TV series do not make their starring cast members sign contracts which last longer than six years. If a TV show is successful enough that it lasts longer than six years, the starring cast members can renegotiate their contracts - and because the show is now a guaranteed hit, their pay can increase drastically. A starring cast member on a longrunning and popular TV series can easily leave the show after the sixth season and enter into a lucrative film career, being paid ''millions'' of dollars instead of the several hundred thousand that a TV series can easily afford to pay them in the same time period. A hit TV series might be popular enough and generate enough revenue to sustain this - but the ''Game of Thrones'' producers have no way of completely guaranteeing that the TV series's ratings will be as high three seasons in the future.\n\nAs a result, in Season 4 the executive producers started backtracking and saying that they had ''always'' intended for only seven seasons, because they were in heavy contract negotiations between the starring cast and [[HBO]]. Now unsure if they would have more than seven seasons (even though they had previously said they felt they needed at least eight to tell the story in full), they didn't want to promise more than they could confirm.\n\nWesteros.org therefore theorized that going into Season 5, the writers were adapting to a &quot;worst case scenario mode&quot; for the event that they only had seven seasons. This included drastically cutting several major subplots from the novels, such as omitting [[House Greyjoy]]'s subplots almost entirely, not making mention of [[Doran Martell]]'s other children (including his daughter and heir, Arianne), and cutting out many major characters that appear in Tyrion's storyline in the Free Cities. They went on to speculate, however, that once Season 5 had finished production, the TV writers would probably know how the cast contract negotiations worked out, and if it was indeed confirmed that they would get more than seven seasons, they would then restructure accordingly - i.e. not omitting these storylines, but pushing them back to Season 6.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q69aQeKWLQ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs events unfolded, it was announced in October 2014 that HBO was indeed able to reach a settlement with the starring cast members: based on the unprecedented and continued success of the TV series, HBO agreed to give them all major pay raises. Part of this involved instituting a pay-grade system: while it a large ensemble cast, a few cast members who can arguably be called the core cast. These &quot;Tier A&quot; cast members as they called them were [[Peter Dinklage]] (Tyrion Lannister), [[Lena Headey]] (Cersei Lannister), [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] (Jaime Lannister), [[Kit Harington]] (Jon Snow), and [[Emilia Clarke]] (Daenerys Targaryen).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-cast-signs-season-744314 ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maisie Williams]] (Arya Stark) and [[Sophie Turner]] (Sansa Stark) are not in the Tier A cast - it is possible they aren't paid as much due to being underaged. A later interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'' in March 2015 reported that for Season 5, the Tier A cast members were each paid $300,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/hbo-wants-more-than-seven-seasons-of-game-of-thrones-new-inside-information-on-season-5/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs predicted, with these cast contract renegotiations settled, HBO and the writers began intimating that the TV series could run for more than seven seasons. In the same ''Entertainment Weekly'' interview, HBO programming president Michael Lombardo said that the network would eagerly accept the TV series going on for eight to ten seasons, but only if writers Benioff and Weiss felt it served the story instead of dragging it out (though of course, the TV series has not been &quot;padding&quot; the massive novels series, but omitting many subplots for time). Lombardo said:\n\n:&quot;We'll have an honest conversation that explores all possible avenues. If they [Benioff and Weiss] weren't comfortable going beyond seven seasons, I trust them implicitly and trust that's the right decision\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;as horrifying as that is to me. What I'm not going to do is have a show continue past where the creators believe where they feel they've finished with the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/11/game-thrones-end ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTherefore, now that the crunch of the cast contract renegotiations in Season 5 is over, it seems that HBO is adopting more of a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude, and while unlikely, they no longer dismiss out of hand the possibility of the show running for ten seasons. This also might mean that plotlines that were omitted in Season 5 will somehow be reintegrated back into Season 6.\n\nWesteros.org, WatchersOnTheWall.com, and ''Entertainment Weekly'' all agreed, however, that what increasingly seems most probable is that like other major TV series such as ''Mad Men'', ''Game of Thrones'' will probably end with a &quot;double-sized&quot; seventh season, which is then split into two halves and aired a year apart (i.e. 16 episodes instead of 10, broken into two 8 episode blocks). This would ''functionally'' result in the TV series getting &quot;eight seasons&quot;, though for purposes of prohibitively expensive cast contract negotiations, it technically wouldn't count as another full season.\n\nBenioff and Weiss also noted in the March 2015 ''Entertainmenet Weekly'' interview that the pay issue has largely been solved after successful negotiations, and the series continues to bring in revenue with high ratings, but the major issue they deal with now is the time issue: ''Game of Thrones'' is one of the largest TV productions in history, spanning multiple countries with different units filming simultaneously, and the shooting schedule for Season 5 officially lasted a massive 202 days. As they have said before, they physically cannot hope to produce more than 10 episodes at such high quality in a single year, and the scale keeps increasing, with an ever-expanding cast and new set locations. As Weiss said:\n\n:&quot;The money issue was largely supplanted by the time issue. There\u00e2&euro;&trade;s still the money issue; since television budgets are not movie budgets, you\u00e2&euro;&trade;re always making Sophie\u00e2&euro;&trade;s choices in terms of visual effects. We ran up against the absolute limit of how many days we can shoot in a year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/17/game-thrones-showrunners?asdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Catching up with the books===\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin himself, in the same April 2014 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', addressed the major and related question which is frequently asked: what will happen if the TV series outpaces the remaining books? What if Martin cannot finish the next novel (the sixth, ''The Winds of Winter'') before Season 6 has to enter production?\n\nMartin stated that while he is trying to focus on writing the remaining novels, he is opposed to ''rushing'' them to finish to match the TV series, given that he wants his novels to stand the test of time for decades, like J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings''. Thus while Martin is hurrying, he has accepted that it a real possibility that he cannot finish the next two novels in time.\n\nMartin declined writing an episode for Season 5 to focus on writing ''The Winds of Winter'', and in March 2015 canceled all of his future convention appearances to focus on writing it. Even so, it now appears all but certain that at least the final season of the TV series will probably be released before the final novel, ''A Dream of Spring''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/ASoWS/News/Entry/GRRM_on_Season_5_Cancelling_Appearances ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "External links": "* [http://watchersonthewall.com/ WatchersOnTheWall.com] - a fansite dedicated to covering all developments on the production as they happen.  \n* [http://www.westeros.org/GoT/ Westeros.org] - a subset of the Westeros.org website which covers developments on the series.\n* &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:13px;font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;color:#000000;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;[http://britmovietours.com/bookings/game-of-thrones-tour-of-locations-belfast Game of Thrones Tour Belfast]&lt;/span&gt; - A tour of filming locations in Belfast Northern Ireland.\n*{{WP|Game of Thrones}}\n*{{AWOIAF|Game of Thrones}}\n\n", "Premise": "The series is set on a world where the seasons can last for years at a time. The main setting is the continent of [[Westeros]], which was home to seven feuding kingdoms until they were united by the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] family using [[dragons]] some three centuries ago. The dragons died out and the Targaryen [[Mad King]] was unseated in a civil war led by Lords [[Robert Baratheon]] and [[Eddard Stark]], seventeen years before the series opens. Robert has ruled as King ever since, but when the series opens his rule is increasingly undermined by other factions. At the same time, two surviving Targaryen children, having grown to adulthood in exile on the eastern continent of [[Essos]], are now planning to return and retake the [[Iron Throne]], and to this end are seeking a military alliance with other factions.\n\nAs both civil war and an external invasion threaten Westeros, another danger arises in the lands to the far north, beyond the vast [[Wall]] that forms the realm's northern border, where [[White Walkers|a supernatural threat]] believed to be mythical seems to be stirring after millennia of sleep. The only defense lies with the [[Night's Watch]], an under-manned, under-funded order of soldiers once held in honor but now used as a dumping ground for criminals and exiles.\n\n", "Writers": "* [[David Benioff]] &amp; [[D.B.

But it\u00e2&euro;&trade;s basically run the same way the past few years. As we\u00e2&euro;&trade;re shooting one season we\u00e2&euro;&trade;re trading emails and/or chatting on set about the broad strokes of the next season: \u00e2&euro;?Character X\u00e2&euro;? starts at \u00e2&euro;&oelig;blank\u00e2&euro;? and we want him or her to end up at \u00e2&euro;&oelig;blank.\u00e2&euro;? Then, as we start to approach the end of production, David and Dan, in some years, will assign the various writers a few characters. For instance, when we were working on Season 4, I was assigned Arya and a few others. So I\u00e2&euro;&trade;d go home and work for a few weeks on my \u00e2&euro;&oelig;Arya Season 4,\u00e2&euro;? keeping in mind a few scenes we\u00e2&euro;&trade;d already discussed and what chapters and scenarios and themes from the books we might use.\n\n:Then, in January, when we\u00e2&euro;&trade;re back in L.A., we\u00e2&euro;&trade;d meet for about two or three weeks, armed with the work we\u00e2&euro;&trade;d all done individually, and throw it all up on the board. You debate, you use some stuff, you throw some stuff out, you think up some new stuff. Sometimes what you end up with is really close to the individual outlines. Sometimes it's very different.\n\n:After we map out all the main characters\u00e2&euro;&trade; individual arcs, using color-coded index cards, we arrange them by episode and get a rough idea of the scene order. From there, we all split up again and each tackle a chunk of the outline\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;a detailed outline, which sometimes ends up being over a hundred pages. David and Dan polish it, and that\u00e2&euro;&trade;s what we use to script our episodes. I\u00e2&euro;&trade;m generally assigned mid-season episodes\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;it just seems to work out that way. George wrote a script per season for the first four seasons, but took a break for Season 5 as he\u00e2&euro;&trade;s hard at work on the next book. And while George isn't in the writers room, he reads the outlines and gives his notes.\n\n:From there I write my two scripts\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;it takes me about a month and half to do both\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;D&amp;D read them, give notes, I do a rewrite, D&amp;D sometimes do a pass on it themselves. And we continue to tinker with all of the scripts through prep and production. But they\u00e2&euro;&trade;re generally camera-ready when we finish them. They have to be, as we have to have all 10 scripts complete well before shooting starts. We shoot all 10 episodes simultaneously, out of order, like a big, 10-hour movie, with two shooting units going at all times, sometimes in different countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2015/04/blood-caffeine-sex-magic-how-game-of-thrones-gets-written/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCogman went on to explain that, as of Season 5, there were never more than four people in the writers' room at any one time.  Martin didn't actually sit in the writers room even when he wrote one episode each year in Seasons 1 to 3 (he didn't move to Northern Ireland to oversee filming for months at a time the way they did), though they sent him their outlines and he would send them back with notes.  In Season 1 the only three people sitting in the writers' room and discussing the scripts were Benioff, Weiss, and Cogman.  Jane Espenson wrote one episode in Season 1, but as she has explained, they gave her a copy of the book filled with stick-it notes and strict instructions to adapt a certain page range - but she was not actively contributing on the rest of the season as a whole, and left after Season 1.  In Season 2 Vanessa Taylor joined the show and became the fourth person (and only woman) sitting in the writer's room discussions.  Taylor stayed through Season 3 but did not return for Season 4, and in Season 5 assistant Dave Hill was promoted up to be a new full staff writer, bringing the number of people in the room back up to four.  Cogman said that he felt having such a small number of writers helped keep the show more focused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2015/04/blood-caffeine-sex-magic-how-game-of-thrones-gets-written/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Filming locations": "* Northern Ireland ([[wikipedia:Northern Ireland Screen#The Paint Hall|The Paint Hall Studios]] in Belfast is being used for all primary interior sets.)\n* Malta (season 1)\n* Croatia (season 2-)\n* Iceland (season 2-)\n* Morocco (season 3)\n* Spain (season 5-)\n\n"}, "title": "Game of Thrones (TV series)"}
