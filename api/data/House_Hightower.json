Their seat is the oldest city in Westeros. They call it Oldtown. Wealthy, proud, and solitary, there have been Hightowers who wouldn't come down from their great lighthouse for decades. Its name, fittingly, the Hightower.|[[Margaery Tyrell]]|The Reach (Histories &amp; Lore)}}\n'''House Hightower''' is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Tyrell]] of [[Highgarden]]. [[The Hightower]]\u00c2\u00a0is their seat, it resides in the port city of [[Oldtown]], southwest of [[Highgarden]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Hightower is a powerful family with strong ties to the Tyrells. The family is very old, existing since the Dawn of Days when they were petty-kings. During the coming of the [[Andals]] and the creation of the Kingdom of the Reach, the Hightowers allied with the newcomers. Thus they were able the keep their wealth, lands and privileges. House Hightower rarely takes part in wars within the realm. They were integral in the foundation of [[the Citadel]] and continue to be patrons of both the Order of Maesters and [[the Faith of the Seven]].\n\nHouse Hightower is said to be as rich as [[House Lannister]] and can field three times as many swords as other Tyrell bannermen, as they have vassals of their own, such as [[House Cuy]]. More, if they took everyone possible out of [[Oldtown]]. The four-decked ''Honor of Oldtown'' is the flagship of the Hightower\u00c2\u00a0fleet. In the [[War of the Five Kings]], thus far the Hightowers have followed the Tyrell lead, declaring for [[Renly Baratheon]]\u00c2\u00a0on the outbreak of the conflict, and not changing to [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s\u00c2\u00a0side after Renly's assassination.\n\nThe house is led by Lord Leyton Hightower. The sigil of House Hightower is a stone white watchtower, with a fire on the top.
