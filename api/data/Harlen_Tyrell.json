Thankfully for everyone, my ancestor Harlen Tyrell had better sense. Until the Maesters sorted out the entail among Mern\u00e2&euro;&trade;s cousins, Harlen the steward was acting Lord of Highgarden. To ensure peace and life in the Reach he would yield the castle to Aegon. The other castles and families would then follow, as they had since the Dawn Age.|[[Margaery Tyrell]]|House Tyrell (Histories &amp; Lore)}}\n'''Harlen Tyrell''' is an unseen character in ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]].'' He is not expected to appear, being long dead by the time it begins.\n\nHarlen was the [[steward]] of [[Highgarden]] during the reign of King [[Mern Gardener|Mern IX]] of [[the Reach]]. After the death of his king in the [[Field of Fire]], Harlen surrendered [[Highgarden]] to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. Afterward, Aegon elevated Harlen to [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]] and [[Warden of the South]] and [[House Tyrell]] to the status of a [[Great House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/highgarden/ HBO viewers guide entry on Highgarden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[House Tyrell (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAccording to\u00c2\u00a0[[Olenna Tyrell]], Harlen was like most Tyrell men and grew up banging steel too loudly for thought to penetrate, like his descendants Luthor, Mace, and Loras. \u00c2\u00a0She also implies that it was Harlen's wife who came up with the idea to surrender to Aegon and convinced Harlen to go along with it.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Reach (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Harlen Tyrell"}
