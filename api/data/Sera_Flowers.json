Despite being a bastard and the fact her mother's family are ashamed of her she managed to become a handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell. Sera appears to be embarrassed about being a bastard so she seeks to keep it a secret from anyone that she doesn't trust and hopes to marry into a noble family so that she can replace her last name.\n\n===&quot;[[Iron From Ice]]&quot;===\nSera is shown to be good friends with fellow handmaiden [[Mira Forrester]], and is on good terms with Lady Margaery. She is present when Margaery notifies Mira of Cersei's suspicion towards her and her house, and announces to the Throne Room Mira and Margaery's arrival. Afterwards, Sera asks Mira how it went, before the two joke about the various men present at court. Sera states that she wouldn't mind marrying Joffrey if it would mean she could be queen. Depending on the player's choice, Mira can either appease Margaery for assistance for her house with or without Sera in presence. Later on if Sera is allowed to stay and listen to Mira's proposal she is sympathetic and asks if she can help, if she is told to leave she is upset and questions her friendship with Mira.\n\n===&quot;[[The Lost Lords]]&quot;===\n''TBA''\n\n===&quot;[[The Sword in the Darkness]]&quot;===\n''TBA''\n\n===&quot;[[Sons of Winter]]&quot;===\nSera will appear in this episode.\n\n"}, "title": "Sera Flowers"}
