He died in [[Assassination of Jon Arryn|mysterious circumstances]] just prior to the events of the series. He is played by guest star [[John Standing]] and appears only as a corpse in the [[Winter is Coming (episode)|series premiere]]. He was the [[Lord of the Eyrie]], [[Warden|Warden of the East]], [[Defender of the Vale]], and [[Hand of the King]] to [[Robert Baratheon]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jon Arryn is a great lord, wise counselor, and canny tactician. He is loved as a second father by both Eddard and Robert, and commanded great respect in [[the Vale of Arryn]]. His nephew and heir Elbert Arryn was among [[Brandon Stark (Son of Rickard)|Brandon Stark]]'s companions who were imprisoned and killed by the Mad King, sparking Jon Arryn's decision to join the rebellion.\n\nJon Arryn's first wife, Lady Jeyne Royce, died in childbirth, and their daughter was stillborn. His second wife, Rowena, died without issue. Lysa Tully, some forty years his junior, became his third wife as part of an alliance with Lord [[Hoster Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. The marriage was loveless and produced only one surviving child, the sickly Robert.\n\nIn the books, [[Eddard Stark]] discovered that Arryn and [[Stannis Baratheon]] inquired together about Cersei's children and Robert's bastards. In fact it was Stannis who initiated the investigation, while in the TV series he is not mentioned at all in respect of Arryn's actions prior to his death.\n\nWhen Tyrion confronts Pycelle with his guards, Pycelle admits that Jon Arryn was being treated by maester Colemon, who was going to give him purges to get the poison out. Pycelle, aware that Arryn knew the secret of Cersei's incest, sent the other maester away and just gave Lord Arryn painkillers to ease his passing. In the TV series the emphasis is slightly different: Pycelle presents it as that he simply didn't intervene when he realized Lord Arryn was poisoned, though Tyrion points out that even his inaction when he could have saved Lord Arryn makes him an accomplice to the murder. In the TV series, Tyrion just vaguely asserts that Pycelle must have &quot;made sure he succumbed&quot;, but in the book version he goes slightly beyond inaction, deliberately dismissing a maester who might have saved him.\n\nEven in the books, Pycelle didn't know who actually poisoned Jon Arryn, but it was convenient for Pycelle that someone else poisoned him before he had to deal with it.\n\nIn the book, Lysa blurts out the whole truth about Arryn's death while she is dragging [[Sansa Stark]] to the Moon Door. Littlefinger tries in vain to hush Lysa, feeling uncomfortable that she reveals this secret in the presence of Sansa and [[Marillion]].\n\nLysa's reason for poisoning Jon was that he planned on having their son sent to Dragonstone to be fostered by Stannis Baratheon. Littlefinger apparently wanted him dead to trick the Starks and Lannisters into fighting each other (aided by the letter he had Lysa write to Catelyn), and also so he could later marry Lysa and take control over the Vale.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{dialogue a-b|Eddard Stark|Jon was a man of peace.

Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. Indeed, Jon Arryn was essentially the man really holding the realm together for the next seventeen years, while Robert drank and ate and used whores.\n\nJon Arryn died in [[King's Landing]] immediately prior to the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement.
