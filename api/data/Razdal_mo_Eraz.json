He is fluent in the [[Common Tongue]] of [[Westeros]].\n\nUnlike [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]] of Astapor, Razdal is not a braggart, but shrewd and politically savvy. A reserved, calculating man, he is capable of being polite when it is politically expedient. While he is still capable of making threats, they are subdued, part of calculated negotiation tactics instead of emotional outbursts.\n\nLike many of the Wise Masters, he prides himself on Yunkai's descent from the old [[Ghiscari Empire]], which was already old and mighty when the [[Valyrian Freehold]] was young.\n\n===Season 3===\nRazdal mo Eraz is sent by the Wise Masters to negotiate with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] when she sets camp outside of [[Yunkai]] and sends word demanding the surrender of the city. He arrives atop a palanquin carried by several slaves. After being announced, he comes to close to Daenerys but is intimidated away by her [[dragons]]. Razdal offers Daenerys gifts of gold and ships so that Yunkai will be left in peace. Daenerys offers Razdal his own life if he goes back to the Wise Masters and ensures that all slaves are released and given payment for their years of service or else she will lay waste to Yunkai.\n\n[[File:Drogon_protective_S3E7.jpg|thumb|Drogon menaces Razdal.]]\nDumbfounded at her boldness, Razdal stands defiant and retorts that Yunkai has powerful allies and that after the coming battle the Yunkai'i will enslave the survivors, even Daenerys herself, prompting [[Drogon]] to furiously hiss at him. He reminds Daenerys that he was offered safety but she retorts that her dragons react poorly to their &quot;Mother&quot; being threatened. Razdal orders his slaves to take back the gold, but the enraged Drogon stands in their way. Daenerys then sends him away and keeps the gold, as Razdal returns to his palanquin, muttering curses.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Grazdan mo Eraz}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Razdal mo Eraz"}
