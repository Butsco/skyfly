It was formerly a sovereign realm known as the [[Kingdom of the Rock]] before the [[Targaryen]] [[War of Conquest|conquest]].\n\nThe Westerlands are ruled from the castle of [[Casterly Rock]] by [[House Lannister]]. It is one of the smaller regions of the Seven Kingdoms, but is immensely rich in natural resources, particularly metals. Predominantly mountainous, the hills of the Westerlands are riddled with veins of gold and silver, the mining of which has made the Lannisters and their bannermen immensely rich. While the Lannister armies are not as huge as those of the Reach, they are the best-equipped in the realm, with heavily-armored soldiers and cavalry.\n\n[[Bastard]]s born in the Westerlands are given the surname '''Hill'''. People of the Westerlands are collectively known as '''Westernmen''', and are referred to, derogatorily, as '''&quot;lions&quot;''', in reference to the sigil of House Lannister. Colloquially, Westermen are also referred to as '''Lannisters'''.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels the Westerlands consist of a landscape of hills and valleys stretching from the well-watered [[Riverlands]] in the east to the sea in the north and west, and to the fertile plains of [[the Reach]] to the south.\n\n", "Geography": "\nThe Westerlands border [[the Riverlands]] to the east, and [[the Reach]] to the south. The Goldroad links Lannisport on Westeros' west coast with the capital city of [[King's Landing]] on the east coast, passing through the Reach, skirting south of the Riverlands. The Searoad, hugging the coast, links Lannisport with the capital of the Reach at [[Highgarden]] as well as the major city of [[Oldtown]] further south. Predominantly mountainous, the Westerlands are well-defended from external attack. There is only one major pass through the mountains in the east of the Westerlands, near the headwaters of the Red Fork of the [[Trident]] River. Thus there is only one narrow and predictable path that armies moving between the Westerlands and Riverlands can normally take, and it is guarded by the castle of Golden Tooth.\n\nThe Westerlands border on the waters of Ironman's Bay to the north, and thus are under threat of [[ironborn]] attacks along the coasts. House Lannister commonly keeps a large fleet of warships to defends against these attacks (thus the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] began with a sneak attack which burned the Lannister fleet at anchor). Apart from its mountainous terrain, the Westerlands are also somewhat better defended from ironborn attacks because they possesses few major rivers which empty into the west coast; this is in contrast with the Reach, which while further south from the Iron Islands, possesses major rivers such as the [[Mander]] which are navigable for a long distance inland.\n\nThe headwaters of the Red Fork of the [[Trident]] River originate in the Westerlands' eastern border but do not run through much of it before passing into the Riverlands to the east. The only major river in the Westerlands is in the north, where the Tumblestone river flows east. Ultimately the Tumblestone passes into the Riverlands, where it joins the Red Fork coming up from the south at [[Riverrun]].\n\n===Settlements===\n* [[File:Lannister mini shield.png|30px]] [[Casterly Rock]], the seat of [[House Lannister]], the ruling house of the Westerlands.\n** [[File:Marbrand mini shield.png|30px]] [[Ashemark]], the seat of [[House Marbrand]].\n** [[The Crag]], the seat of [[House Westerling]].\n** [[File:Lefford mini shield.png|30px]] The [[Golden Tooth]], the seat of [[House Lefford]], which guards the main pass from the Westerlands into the Riverlands.\n** [[Lannisport]], the principal city and port of the Westerlands, located in the shadow of Casterly Rock.
