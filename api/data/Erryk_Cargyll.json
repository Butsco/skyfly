Ser Arryk sided with Aegon II, while Ser Erryk sided with Rhaenyra.  \n\nEventually, Ser Arryk was sent to infiltrate Rhaenyra's base of power at [[Dragonstone (castle)|Dragonstone]] castle, pretending to be his twin brother, but he happened to run into Erryk in a hallway.  In the ensuing duel, each brother died at the point of the other's sword.  In some ways it was a microcosm of the entire Dance of the Dragons:  a destructive civil war that set brother against brother, and for which there was no winner but mutual destruction.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nSer Erryk was the twin brother of Ser Arryk Cargyll, who was also a member of the Kingsguard.\n===[[The Kingsguard (Histories &amp; Lore)]]===\nSer Erryk and Ser Arryk Cargyll are mentioned as being twin brothers who ended up on opposite sides of the Targaryen civil war known as the [[Dance of the Dragons]].
