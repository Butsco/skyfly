Some of the other Unsullied, however - those who were born into slavery and don't remember their original names - do take up the suggestion to make new dignified names for themselves, such as &quot;Stalwart Shield&quot;.  \n\nThe TV series may have thought this would take too long to explain, so they renamed the character &quot;White Rat&quot; to keep with the previously established thematic naming of the Unsullied (&quot;Grey Worm&quot;, &quot;Red Flea&quot;, etc.)\n\n"}, "title": "White Rat"}
