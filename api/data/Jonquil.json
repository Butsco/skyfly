Jonquil is the heroine of a legend. According to the legend, she was the lover of [[Florian]], a foolish [[knight]] who fell in love with her when he saw her bathing with her sisters in [[Maidenpool]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/maidenpool/ HBO viewers guide entry on Maidenpool]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\n[[Tywin Lannister]] points out to [[Arya Stark]] that most girls are primarily interested in the pretty maidens from the songs, like Jonquil, and tying flowers in their hair. Arya is more interested in warrior-princesses, like [[Visenya Targaryen]], than pretty maidens in epic romances like Jonquil, and feels that &quot;most girls&quot; are idiots, much to Lord Tywin's amusement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", " See also ": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Jonquil"}
