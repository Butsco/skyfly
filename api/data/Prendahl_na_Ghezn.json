He rejects Daenerys' offer of breaking the Second Sons' contract with the [[Wise Masters]] and watches as Mero rudely snubs Daenerys' offers.\n\nPrendahl then discusses how to deal with Daenerys with Mero and Daario. To avoid facing her [[Unsullied]] Mero proposes that one of them slips into Daenerys' camp and assassinate her. He gives three different coins - a [[Meereen]]ese, a [[Braavos]]i, and a [[Volantis|Volantene]] - to the [[Yunkai'i whore|bedslave]] attending them and has her hand them out at random to the three of them, the one with the Braavosi coin being charged with the assassination. Daario winds up with the Braavosi coin. Later that night, after sneaking into Daenerys' pavilion, Daario presents Prendahl's head, along with that of Mero. He explains that he, Mero and Daario had &quot;philosophical differences&quot; about Daenerys' beauty and forced Daario to kill her, and he refused, and they fought him but lost. He then pledges the Second Sons to Daenerys.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n"}, "title": "Prendahl na Ghezn"}
