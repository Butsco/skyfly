It is the sixteenth episode of the series overall. It premiered on May 6, 2012. It was written by co-executive producer [[Vanessa Taylor]] and directed by [[David Nutter]].\n\nThe episode won a [[wikipedia:Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Make-Up (Non-Prosthetic) in September 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/ Westeros.org]&lt;/ref&gt;.\n\n", "In the books": ": ''See: [[Differences between books and TV series - Season 2#The Old Gods and the New]] ''\n* The episode is adapted from the following chapters of ''A Clash of Kings'':\n** Chapter 34, Jon IV: Jon is unable to keep Ghost close to him.\n** Chapter 36, Tyrion VIII: Littlefinger positions himself to negotiate with House Tyrell.\n** Chapter 37, Theon III: a northerner is killed at the insistence of Theon's men.\n** Chapter 38, Arya VIII: Arya orders a second murder from Jaqen.\n** Chapter 39, Catelyn V: Catelyn returns from the Stormlands, context changed dramatically.\n** Chapter 40, Daenerys III: Daenerys is unable to obtain ships through negotiation.\n** Chapter 41, Tyrion IX: Myrcella departs to Dorne and the people of King's Landing riot.\n** Chapter 46, Bran VI: Bran awakens to find Theon in Winterfell and surrenders the castle to him.\n** Chapter 50, Theon IV: Theon sends word to Deepwood Motte for help.

Theon had lured the defenders away with a feint at [[Torrhen's Square]] and then infiltrated the castle using grappling claws. Theon tells [[Bran Stark]] to surrender the castle to him to save his people. Bran submits in front of his assembled people. Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] is captured by Theon's men as he is returning from Torrhen's Square. He spits in Theon's face, and [[Dagmer Cleftjaw]] insists that Theon must kill him, or lose face in front of his [[ironborn]] raiders. Theon botches the beheading of Ser Rodrik, horrifying the people of Winterfell. Later that night, [[Osha]] the [[Free Folk|wildling]] has sex with Theon, but then sneaks out of his room while he is asleep. Osha frees Bran, [[Rickon Stark]], [[Hodor]], and their [[direwolves]], [[Summer]] and [[Shaggydog]], smuggling them out of the castle and\u00c2\u00a0killing one of Theon's guards in the process.\n\nAt King [[Robb Stark]]'s army camp in [[the Westerlands]], Robb chats with [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]], who has followed his forces on their campaign. Robb introduces Talisa to his mother [[Catelyn Stark]], who has returned from [[the Stormlands]] along with [[Brienne of Tarth]] . They are interrupted when Lord [[Roose Bolton]] arrives with the terrible news sent by Luwin's last messenger raven. Furious at Theon's betrayal, Robb intends to march his army back to the North to repel the invasion. Roose advises that the few hundred soldiers left scattered in the North can be rallied by his bastard son, [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]], who is in the North at [[the Dreadfort]]. They could overcome the small Ironborn invasion force. Roose warns that retreating the entire Northern army group would lose everything they have gained. Robb agrees, but insists that Bolton's men take Theon alive so Robb can look him in the eyes and ask &quot;Why?&quot; before personally executing him.\n\nAt the [[Harrenhal]] castle, in the main base camp for the [[House Lannister]] army in the Riverlands, Tywin Lannister berates Ser [[Amory Lorch]] for delivering a letter to their enemies instead of their allies, because he cannot read properly. He discovers that his cupbearer &quot;Arry&quot; (secretly [[Arya Stark]]) can read. [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish]] arrives at camp and meets with Tywin. Arya tries to hide her face to prevent Littlefinger from identifying her. Baelish discusses the assassination of [[Renly Baratheon]], and the subsequent rallying of the noble Houses from [[the Stormlands]] under the banner of his older brother [[Stannis Baratheon]]. However, [[House Tyrell]] of [[the Reach]] has retreated its large army back to their capital at [[Highgarden]], and has not joined Stannis. Baelish discusses with Tywin the possibility of forming an alliance between House Lannister and House Tyrell.\n\nLater Tywin questions Arya about her origins. While Tywin is distracted, Arya sees that a letter on his table is about her older brother Robb Stark, so she snatches it. She reads the letter and then runs downstairs with it. She bumps into Amory Lorch who sees that she is carrying the letter and grows suspicious. Arya runs away and Amory heads to tell Tywin. Arya runs to find [[Jaqen H'ghar]]. She tells Jaqen that Amory Lorch is the second name he owes her. Just as Amory Lorch opens Tywin's door, he falls down dead, a poisoned dart lodged in his neck.\n\n[[File:JoffreyAttackedSeason2.png|thumb|left|Joffrey has excrement thrown on him by rioting peasants.]]\nIn [[King's Landing]], the royal court including King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]], Prince [[Tommen Baratheon]], and [[Sansa Stark]] are at the docks seeing off Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]] as she departs in a ship bound for [[Dorne]]. Cersei is heartbroken and warns Tyrion that she will not forgive him for sending away her only daughter. As per Tyrion's plans, Myrcella will stay in Dorne with [[House Martell]] until she comes of age to fulfill the marriage alliance to their youngest son, [[Trystane Martell]]. The [[High Septon (Before the riot of King's Landing)|High Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]] offers a blessing for her departure. The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the [[War of the Five Kings]], as Cersei ignored both Tyrion and Janos Slynt's earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving [[smallfolk|peasants]] or there would be mounting discontent with her son's rule.\n\n[[File:SansaAlmostRapedSeason2.png|thumb|Sansa is almost raped.]]\nAs the royal party travels back to the [[Red Keep]] through the crowded streets, the starving refugees and commoners of King's Landing plead for bread and hurl insults at King Joffrey, and ultimately, someone throws cow excrement into Joffrey's face. Despite being accompanied by only a few dozen guards facing hundreds of peasants, Joffrey impetuously orders his soldiers to kill the entire crowd. [[Riot of King's Landing|A riot erupts and spreads throughout the city]]. The royal party's guards are soon overwhelmed, and Joffrey, Cersei and Tyrion barely make it back to the castle unscathed. The High Septon is literally torn apart by the mob.\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is enraged by Joffrey's shocking stupidity, for massively overreacting to having cow dung thrown at him, and for not realizing that his orders would cause a riot among the starving peasants and endanger the entire royal party. Joffrey, still manically cursing the mob and demanding they all be killed, shrieks that Tyrion cannot speak to him in that way. Tyrion then slaps him across the face. The scant two thousand [[City Watch]] guards have difficulty containing the riot, and chaos reigns throughout the city. Tyrion realizes to his horror that Sansa Stark was lost in the crowd. Joffrey petulantly refuses to send his men after her, oblivious to her importance as a [[hostage]] or the fact that if any harm comes to her, his uncle [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] will be in danger. Outside, Sansa is dragged away by a mob of angry men and is about to be raped, when [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane]] arrives and slays her assailants. He carries Sansa to the castle and orders handmaids to take care of her. Tyrion thanks him for saving Sansa's life, but Sandor bluntly responds that he didn't do it for him.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\n[[File:YgritteSeason5.png|thumb|left|Jon first lays eyes on [[Ygritte]].]]\nThe scouting party of the [[Night's Watch]] led by [[Qhorin Halfhand]] has left the expeditionary base their main force set up at the [[Fist of the First Men]], and continues searching for the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] in the [[Frostfangs]] mountain range. They encounter a small group of wildling scouts and engage them in combat, killing all except one: a red-haired young woman named [[Ygritte]]. Qhorin orders [[Jon Snow]] to execute her while the rest of them continue on up the mountain. Jon hesitates, giving Ygritte enough time to make a run for it. Jon pursues and captures Ygritte, but they have become separated from Qhorin's scouting party. With darkness falling, Jon and his prisoner have to settle in for the night, hoping to link back up with Qhorin when daylight returns.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\n[[File:DanyDiscoversDeadPeopleSeason2.png|thumb|Daenerys discovers that her guards have been slain and her dragons are missing.]]In [[Qarth]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] tries to negotiate with the [[Spice King]] for ships to return to [[Westeros]]. However, he considers it to be too risky an investment - considering that she has no army and has no open supporters in Westeros - and she receives nothing. Returning with [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] to his mansion, they find Xaro's guards dead, [[Irri]] strangled to death, and Daenerys' [[dragons]] missing, their cages empty. A hooded figure carries the dragons in a covered box up steps towards a tower.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Charles Dance]] as Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as Prince [[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Richard Madden]] as King [[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Sophie Turner]] as Princess [[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as Prince [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Jack Gleeson]] as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as [[Shae]]\n*[[Rory McCann]] as [[Sandor Clegane]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Guest starring'''\n*[[Donald Sumpter]] as Maester [[Luwin]]\n*[[Ron Donachie]] as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]]\n*[[Michael McElhatton]] as Lord [[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Nonso Anozie]] as [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Nicholas Blane]] as the [[Spice King]]\n*[[Tom Wlaschiha]] as [[Jaqen H'ghar]]\n*[[Rose Leslie]] as [[Ygritte]]\n*[[Gwendoline Christie]] as [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Oona Chaplin]] as [[Talisa Maegyr]]\n*[[Simon Armstrong]] as [[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as [[Dagmer|Dagmer Cleftjaw]]\n*[[Ian Beattie]] as Ser [[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Fintan McKeown]] as Ser [[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Forbes KB]] as [[Lorren|Black Lorren]]\n*[[Amrita Acharia]] as [[Irri]]\n*[[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n*[[Steven Cole]] as [[Kovarro]]\n*[[David Verrey]] as the [[High Septon (Before the riot of King's Landing)|High Septon]]\n*[[Peter Ballance]] as [[Farlen]]\n*[[David Coakley]] as [[Drennan]]\n*[[Aimee Richardson]] as Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Art Parkinson]] as Prince [[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Callum Wharry]] as Prince [[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Reg Wayment]] as a [[King's Landing rioter 1|rioter]]\n*[[Aiden Condron]] as a [[Lannister captain]]\n*[[Marko Juraga]] as a [[King's Landing rioter 2|rioter]]\n*[[Rea Separovic]] as a [[King's Landing rioter 3|rioter]]\n*[[Paul Caddell]] as [[Jacks]]\n*[[Aidan Crowe]] as [[Quent]]\n\n'''Uncredited'''\n*Unknown as [[Palla]]\n*Unknown as [[Malakho]]\n*Unknown as Ser [[Arys Oakheart]]\n*Unknown as [[Harker]]\n*Unknown as [[Stonesnake]]\n*Unknown as [[Borba]]\n*Unknown as a [[Stark guard (The Old Gods and the New)|Stark guard]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n*Only 15 of the 25 starring cast members for the second season appear in this episode.\n*Starring cast members [[John Bradley]] ([[Samwell Tarly]]), [[James Cosmo]] ([[Jeor Mormont]]), [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] ([[Jaime Lannister]]), [[Liam Cunningham]] ([[Davos Seaworth]]), [[Stephen Dillane]] ([[Stannis Baratheon]]), [[Natalie Dormer]] ([[Margaery Tyrell]]), [[Jerome Flynn]] ([[Bronn]]), [[Iain Glen]] ([[Jorah Mormont]]), [[Conleth Hill]] ([[Varys]]), and [[Carice van Houten]] ([[Melisandre]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n*[[Jack Gleeson]] is credited after [[Sophie Turner]] and [[Maisie Williams]] when he was credited ahead of them when they last appeared together in &quot;[[Garden of Bones]].&quot;\n*In the opening titles, Jack Gleeson, who plays Joffrey Baratheon, has his sigil changed to a Stark [[direwolf]], rather than a Baratheon stag.\n\n", "Notes": "*The title refers to the [[Old Gods]] worshiped primarily in [[the North]] and the Seven-Faced god of the [[Faith of the Seven]], also referred to as the New God or Gods.
