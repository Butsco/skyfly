But I'm losing this war.|Robb Stark|The North Remembers}}\n'''Robb Stark'''\u00c2\u00a0is a major character in the [[Season 1|first]], [[Season 2|second]], and [[Season 3|third]] seasons. He is played by starring cast member [[Richard Madden]], and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming|series premiere]]. Robb is the eldest son of Lord [[Eddard Stark]] of [[Winterfell]] and his wife Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], brother of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]], and half-brother of [[Jon Snow]]. He adopts a [[direwolf]] named [[Grey Wind]].\n\nWhen Eddard is arrested and subsequently executed by King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], Robb is declared [[King in the North]], and leads a rebellion against the [[Iron Throne]]. In the resulting [[War of the Five Kings|conflict]], he proves himself an adept battle commander, securing several notable victories over [[House Lannister|Lannister]] forces and capturing [[Jaime Lannister]]. However, he is a naive and inexperienced politician, putting honorable conduct over practical concerns, and makes a number of crucial blunders. He breaks an oath to marry a daughter of his ally [[Walder Frey]], choosing instead to marry [[Talisa Maegyr]], and he entrusts [[Theon Greyjoy]] to negotiate an alliance with the [[ironborn]], but Theon betrays him and seizes Winterfell. Robb then alienates the [[House Karstark|Karstarks]], who make up nearly half of his remaining army, when he executes their leader [[Rickard Karstark]], after Rickard kills two young\u00c2\u00a0Lannister boys.\n\nWith the war turning against him, Robb is forced to turn to the Freys again. He seemingly wins back their support by agreeing for his uncle [[Edmure Tully]] to marry [[Roslin Frey]]. Unbeknownst to Robb, it is a trap, as the Freys and Stark bannerman [[Roose Bolton]] are now in league with [[Tywin Lannister]]. At the wedding feast, despite invoking [[guest right]], the Freys turn on the Starks, and Robb, Catelyn, Talisa and most of his army are massacred in what becomes known as the [[Red Wedding]]. Robb himself is personally killed by Roose Bolton. This effectively ends the northern rebellion, and the Starks are stripped of their ancestral seat in [[the North]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Robb is 14 years old when the story begins. He is his father's son, with a keen sense of honor and justice. Robb is not a POV character, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as his mother and Theon\u00c2\u00a0Greyjoy. Robb is largely a background character in the second and third novels; important events in his life, including his successes at Oxcross, Ashemark, and the Crag, and his marriage, are only revealed when POV characters learn of them or discuss them.\n\nThere are some minor differences from the books. He tells Bran that when Grey Wind tore off the Greatjon's fingers, he was very scared about the possible consequences but couldn't show it. Later, he accepts his mother's tactical advice while splitting his army in two, appointing the cautious, experienced [[Roose Bolton]] in command of the army tasked with delaying the Lannisters at the Green Fork.\n\nRobb's appearance in the books is also different - he is described in the books as having the thick auburn hair of the Tullys, while on the show Robb has dark brown curly hair and a more lean build. [[Brandon Stark|Bran Stark]]'s hair color is also darker on the TV series. In the books, all of Eddard's children except Arya (and of course, Jon Snow) inherited from their mother Catelyn the typical House Tully features of auburn hair and blue eyes.\n\n[[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]] does not appear in the novels. The woman Robb falls in love with is Jeyne Westerling, a noblewoman of [[House Westerling]], an ancient but impoverished vassal house of the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] in the Westerlands. Robb is wounded while storming the Westerlings' ancestral castle, [[the Crag]], and Jeyne nurses him back to health. She comforts Robb when he is grief-stricken by the (false) reports of the deaths of Bran and Rickon, and they sleep together. Having taken her maidenhood, Robb feels honor bound to marry her, despite his previous oath to marry a daughter of Walder Frey. The fallout from the marriage is much the same as his marriage to Talisa in the TV series, although Jeyne is not present at the Red Wedding. [[Jaime Lannister]] later reflects that Jeyne was &quot;not a beauty to lose a kingdom for.&quot;\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Robb also begins to wear a bronze and iron crown just like his ancestors, the Kings of Winter.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

He lives at [[Winterfell]] with his family.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[File:Robb_1x01.png|thumb|left|190px|Robb at the deserter's execution.]]\nRobb attends the execution of [[Will]], a deserter from the [[Night's Watch]], by his father [[Eddard Stark]]. On their way home with [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], [[Jon Snow|Jon]] and [[Bran Stark|Bran]], they find a litter of newborn [[Direwolves|direwolf]] pups. Robb is surprised that there are any direwolves south of the Wall. When their father says they can keep the pups, Robb adopts one of them as his own, naming him [[Grey Wind]]. He welcomes King [[Robert Baratheon]] to [[Winterfell]] with the rest of his family. He helps [[Catelyn Stark|his mother]] maintain discipline during the feast, removing his sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]] when she starts flicking food at [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], despite his amusement. Robb displays an antipathy to Joffrey from the start, noting that he's a &quot;right royal prick&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBran is left comatose in a fall, and because of his father's departure for [[King's Landing]] and his mother's refusal to leave an unconscious Bran's side, Robb must help Maester [[Luwin]] run the castle making new appointment to the castle's staff. When Catelyn and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] decide that threats from the Lannister's necessitate their departure for the capital, Robb is left in command of Winterfell.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Aware that the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] may be behind Bran's injury, he later greets [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] with hostility, only to be confused when Tyrion gives Bran a special saddle to help him ride.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robb visits a recovering Bran and has to tell him that he will never walk again. Bran says he would rather have died.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Branandrobb.png|thumb|190px|Robb saves Bran from the wildlings.]]\n\nWhile taking Bran outside the castle to test his new saddle, Robb and Theon are talking about Robb's future plans, when they realize that Bran has wandered off. Bran has been taken hostage by a band of [[wildlings]], but they are found by Robb who advances on them with a sword. One of the wildlings [[Stiv]] holds a knife to Bran's throat and makes Robb drop the sword. Theon kills Stiv with an arrow, which angers Robb as Bran could have been injured. Only one of the wildlings is taken prisoner, [[Osha]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Osha says that the greatest danger lies north of [[the Wall]], from the [[White Walkers]], not from the Lannisters in the south, but Robb disregards her warning.&lt;ref name=&quot;E9&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing Robert's death and Eddard's arrest in [[King's Landing]] King Joffrey summons Robb to pay him fealty. Robb instead calls his banners, marching [[House Stark]]'s vassals to war. His youth and inexperience is questioned by [[Greatjon Umber]] who says he will take his armies home. Robb replies that then after they win the Stark army will return to take the lands of House Umber. Enraged, Greatjon starts to draw his sword, but the formidable Northern lord is cowed when Grey Wind attacks and bites off two of his fingers. He laughs it off and becomes one of Robb's most loyal retainers. Robb's army marches south, reuniting with Catelyn and Ser Rodrik along the way and feeding the Lannisters false intelligence on their movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;E9&quot; /&gt; Robb wins the allegiance of the prickly Lord [[Walder Frey]] and his troops by agreeing to marry one of Frey's daughters. He sends a small force of men to distract the main Lannister army under Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] at the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]. Meanwhile, his main army attacks [[Jaime Lannister]]'s forces near [[Riverrun]], winning the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and taking Jaime as a captive.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:The_king_in_the_north.png|thumb|left|190px|Robb Stark is declared the King in the North.]]\n\nRobb is devastated by news of his father's death. He and his lords debate supporting either [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] or [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]'s claim to the throne before the Greatjon says neither appeals and declares Robb the King in the North. Other lords of both the North and the [[Riverlands]] take up the cry. Theon asks Robb to affirm that they are brothers, now and always, and then swears fealty to him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\n[[File:RobbStarkNorthRemembers.jpg|thumb|190px|Robb Stark in &quot;The North Remembers&quot;.]]\n[[File:GreyWindSeason2Debut.jpg|thumb|left|Robb confronts Jaime Lannister with Grey Wind.]]\nRobb continues to win victories against the Lannister army.

He dispatches envoys to seek alliances on his behalf. He sends [[Theon Greyjoy]] to [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]] to treat with his father [[Balon Greyjoy]]. He tasks his mother [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] with forming an alliance with King [[Renly Baratheon]] in [[the Stormlands]]. Robb sends deliberately disagreeable terms to Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] to waste her time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are rejected as expected.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robb wins a crushing victory against a Lannister reinforcement host at the [[Battle of Oxcross]].

They are shocked when news arrives that Theon has betrayed Robb and attacked Winterfell. Robb is furious and agrees to let the bastard son of his bannerman [[Roose Bolton]] retake the castle. He insists that the safety of his brothers is paramount and demands that Theon be brought before him so that he can execute him personally.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobb wins a further victory at the [[Battle of the Yellow Fork]]. His prison cells are filled to overflowing with captives. When Ser Alton returns with Cersei's rejection of his terms he houses him with Jaime. Talisa asks him for help obtaining medical supplies and he invites her to accompany him to negotiate the surrender of [[the Crag]], suggesting that she restock from the castle's stores.

He is recaptured but Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] threatens to behead him to avenge Torrhen.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Catelyn sends her sworn sword [[Brienne of Tarth]] to exchange Jaime for her captive daughters without consulting Robb.&lt;ref name=&quot;E18&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Robb weds Talisa.png|thumb|Robb and Talisa wed.]]\nRobb is furious at the betrayal and orders Catelyn kept under guard. He sends men to find Jaime and devises a plan for Roose's [[Ramsay Snow|bastard son]]; offer mercy to Theon's men if they deliver the Ironborn prince so they will abandon him, allowing him to retake Winterfell with minimal bloodshed. Talisa comforts Robb, revealing more of her past. He confesses not wanting to marry into [[House Frey]] and they sleep together.&lt;ref name=&quot;E18&quot; /&gt; Robb confesses his love for Talisa to Catelyn. Catelyn warns against betraying his oath to marry a daughter of House Frey. Robb rejects her counsel, and in a secret ceremony conducted by a [[Septon (Valar Morghulis)|Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]], he and Talisa secretly marry.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\n[[File:Roose-and-Robb-3x01.jpg|thumb|left|Robb and Roose Bolton discuss their attack on Harrenhal]]Robb's host marches on Harrenhal greatly anticipating the battle ahead, only to find the castle abandoned, and the Northern prisoners slain. Among the dead Robb and his new wife find but one survivor: a maester named [[Qyburn]]. Robb then orders his mother imprisoned within the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobb later\u00c2\u00a0receives two letters, relating to the death of his grandfather [[Hoster\u00c2\u00a0Tully|Hoster&amp;nbsp;Tully]] and the destruction of Winterfell, as well as the &quot;deaths&quot; of Bran and Rickon. Robb informs his mother before setting off for [[Riverrun]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Lord Hoster's funeral, Robb, [[Brynden Tully|Blackfish]], and [[Edmure Tully]] confer in Riverrun's meeting room. The [[War of the Five Kings]] is not going well for them, as now that the Lannisters have defeated their enemies in the south and secured [[King's Landing]] from attack, as well as a marriage-alliance with [[House Tyrell]], they have superior numbers, wealth, and strategic position. Edmure begins to boast to his nephew about the recent victory won by Tully forces under his direct command at the [[Battle of Stone Mill]], which managed to push the Lannister army under Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] from the Riverlands. Instead, Robb and Brynden are furious with Edmure: their grand strategy for the war was to lure Tywin and Gregor's Lannister armies into [[the Westerlands]], where they would be vulnerable out of position, and more importantly, to leave the capital city vulnerable to attack by the Baratheons. Edmure's role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the Lannisters back across the Red Fork of the Trident. Instead, by successfully attacking the Lannisters at Stone Mill, Edmure kept them penned in the Riverlands, and thus close enough to King's Landing that Tywin was able to rush to the defense of the city at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. The Starks' strategic position in the war has been ruined. Edmure insists that they took valuable captives in the battle, [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister]], but Robb angrily points out that he didn't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive. Considering that Tywin didn't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured, taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war. Edmure tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred men at Stone Mill and multiple Lannister soldiers died for every man they lost, at which Robb cuts him off and shouts that they need men more than the Lannisters do. At this point, the Lannisters are in such a good strategic position that they can afford to be patient, and grind down Robb's forces through simple attrition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment|Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe prisoners Martyn and Willem Lannister (squires fifteen and fourteen years old, respectively) awake to hear shouting and fighting outside the door to their cell. Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] fights his way into the room with some of his own men. Confused, Willem asks if this is a rescue, and is promptly killed by the Karstark men. Martyn shouts that he is just a squire and didn't do anything, but Lord Rickard ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger, killing him. \n[[File:Martyn and Willem Lannister dead s3e5.jpg|thumb|Martyn and Willem lie dead before Robb.]]\nThe bloody corpses of the two Lannister prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of Robb in Riverrun's main meeting room. Robb is disgusted, remarking that Karstark needed five men to brutally murder two unarmed squires in their own prison cell. Karstark insists that it was a father's vengeance. Robb points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of Karstark's sons, who were both killed by [[Jaime Lannister]]. Rickard explains that he was denied his vengeance when Catelyn set Jaime free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in King's Landing. Finally having enough, Karstark did the next best thing, and killed Jaime's kin who they held prisoner. Robb angrily shouts that they were only little boys, and that\u00c2\u00a0Karstark can't blame Catelyn for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war. Karstark stands firm, and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go, when in war they should be killing them - if Robb's father ever taught him that. Blackfish punches Karstark over this remark, but Robb tells him to leave Karstark alone. Karstark has utterly lost faith in Robb, and says that the King in the North will just give him a scolding, though he should probably call him &quot;the King Who ''Lost'' the North&quot; after he allowed [[Winterfell]] to fall. Robb orders all of Karstark's men hanged, and to hang the [[Karstark lookout|lookout]] last so he can watch the others die. Rickard Karstark himself is sent to the dungeons.\n\nEdmure insists that if word of this leaves Riverrun, Tywin Lannister will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews. Therefore, he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys, and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over. Robb, however, refuses to be a liar: he says he cannot fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks. All of Robb's advisors tell him this is a bad idea. Catelyn and his Talisa warn him that the Karstark soldiers will abandon his cause and return home if he executes their lord, and they are already badly outnumbered. Catelyn says they should keep Lord Rickard hostage, and Edmure agrees, saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal. \n[[File:Robb_prepares_to_execute_Rickard_s3e5.jpg|thumb|left|Robb executes Rickard.]]\nRobb ignores their pleas, and he has Lord Karstark brought out to the courtyard of Riverrun to be executed during a driving rainstorm. Karstark points out that not only are both of their Houses descended from the [[First Men]], but the Starks and Karstarks are kin (as [[House Karstark]] is a cadet branch of [[House Stark]], founded centuries ago by younger son [[Karlon Stark]]). Robb says that their blood relationship did not stop Rickard from betraying him and won't stop Robb from executing him now, but Rickard says it isn't meant to: he wants it to haunt Robb until the day he dies. With his last words, Lord Rickard says that Robb will be cursed (as a [[kinslaying|kinslayer]]) and that Robb is no king of his. Obedient to the laws of his father [[Eddard Stark]] - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - Robb pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads Lord Rickard.\n\nRobb's strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would: the Karstarks withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home, resulting in Robb losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at Riverrun. Robb openly admits to Talisa that she was right, and he made a mistake. Robb says Tywin Lannister realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the Northerners anymore, he just needs to wait, and let their demoralized forces unravel. When the war began Robb's army was unified around a central purpose, but now they have lost momentum, and his generals are acting like bickering children. Robb shows Talisa a war map of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] - depicting Robb's armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal, [[Lannister]] and [[Tyrell]] armies overrunning [[the Stormlands]], Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King's Landing, and [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoy]] forces occupying the western coasts of [[the North]]. Talisa suggests that he try to take the fight to the Lannisters if they won't come to him, but he explains that this is hopeless. Taking the city would have been difficult to begin with, but now Tywin and the bulk of the main Lannister army, as well as a large Tyrell army, are defending the city. Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide, and Tywin would crush them within a day. Talisa suggests that he lead his army back to the North to repulse the Greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase. Robb points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home, they won't want to leave again - particularly because &quot;winter is coming&quot;, and the coming one is expected to be very long, five years or more. The Northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war, however, so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles. Thus if Robb returns to the North, it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him. Eyeing the map with Talisa, Robb decides that if King's Landing is too strong to attack and he can't return home, his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest. Robb decides that with the main Lannister army group under Tywin now positioned all the way to the east in King's Landing, he needs to return to [[the Westerlands]] and make an all-or-nothing assault against [[Casterly Rock]]. This will make the Lannisters lose face, just as Robb did when he lost his home castle of Winterfell, and bring momentum back to his army. However, with the loss of the Karstark forces, they don't currently have enough men to consider attacking Casterly Rock. The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if Robb can win back the allegiance of [[House Frey]], whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from Robb's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying Talisa, a political nobody, instead of one of the Lord [[Walder Frey]]'s daughters. Thus, Robb must try to repair his alliance with House Frey.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobb and his advisors meet with [[Walder Rivers|&quot;Black Walder&quot;]] and [[Lothar Frey]] to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on [[Casterly Rock]]. The Freys carry Walder Frey's demands for an alliance, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle [[Harrenhal]] and all of its lands and incomes, and for Edmure to marry [[Roslin Frey|Roslin]], one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Climb]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn [[the Riverlands]], en route to [[The Twins]], Robb's army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. Catelyn warns them that the prickly\u00c2\u00a0Lord Frey\u00c2\u00a0will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but Edmure\u00c2\u00a0points out that Frey is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is getting ''a'' wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that Frey wanted one of his daughters wed to [[King in the North|a king]]. Robb retorts that Edmure is the best match [[House Frey]]\u00c2\u00a0has been offered in its history. Later that night as Robb and Talisa prepare for bed,\u00c2\u00a0she reveals that she is pregnant with his child. Robb is gladdened by the news.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobb's army arrives at the Twins, the castle seat of [[House Frey]], for his uncle Edmure's wedding. Enduring\u00c2\u00a0Lord Walder Frey's insults directed at him and his wife, Robb makes a public apology to Lord Frey's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them. Frey accepts the apology and offers the Starks and their men [[Guest right|his hospitality]].\n\n[[File:Robb_and_Talisa_Red_Wedding.jpg|thumb|Robb crawls towards his dead wife]]That night Edmure is introduced to his bride [[Roslin Frey]], discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty. The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs, with all the participants in high spirits. As the celebrations reach their heights Lord Walder calls for the bedding ceremony. Robb agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed, Roslin carried off by the male guests and followed closely by Edmure, who is collected by the Frey women.\n\n[[File:Red_wedding_roose_slider.png|thumb|left|Bolton stabs Robb, killing him]]\nAfter they leave and the festivities begin to wind down, Catelyn becomes suspicious when she notices\u00c2\u00a0[[Walder Rivers|Black Walder Rivers]] close the banquet hall doors and the musicians in the gallery\u00c2\u00a0begin playing &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;- the\u00c2\u00a0song commemorating\u00c2\u00a0[[House Lannister]]'s brutal elimination of [[House Reyne]] . Walder rises to make a toast to Robb, and Catelyn, seated beside Lord [[Roose Bolton]],\u00c2\u00a0notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing. Realizing they are in a trap, Catelyn slaps Roose across the face and screams a warning to Robb, but by then it is too late. Lord Walder signals his men to attack. Lothar draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, fatally wounding her and killing their unborn child. Before he can react, Robb is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the ground. Numerous other Stark men are killed by the assassins or Frey men.\n\nUpon seeing Talisa\u00c2\u00a0dying near him, Robb drags himself towards\u00c2\u00a0her despite his injuries and\u00c2\u00a0manages to hold her in his arms as she dies, heartbroken\u00c2\u00a0at the loss of his beloved wife and unborn child.\u00c2\u00a0Catelyn, having been wounded by a crossbow bolt, manages to take\u00c2\u00a0[[Joyeuse Erenford]] hostage, threatening to kill her if Walder doesn't spare Robb, who lingers despondent beside his wife's corpse. Walder refuses, dismissing his wife as replaceable.\u00c2\u00a0Roose Bolton, who had fled the hall when the\u00c2\u00a0massacre\u00c2\u00a0began, seizes Robb, saying &quot;The Lannisters\u00c2\u00a0send their regards&quot;, before stabbing him in the heart. Mad with grief at the death of her firstborn son, her daughter-in-law and unborn grandchild,\u00c2\u00a0Catelyn kills\u00c2\u00a0Walder's wife before Black Walder kills her as well.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Robb_Wind.png|thumb|The Freys parade Robb's mutilated corpse at the climax of the massacre.]]\n\nAs the [[Red Wedding|massacre]] of Robb's army rages outside the Twins, Robb's body is paraded atop a horse across the keep, with the head removed and replaced with that of his direwolf, [[Grey Wind]], sewn in its place as a final act of mockery to the King in the North. This sight is witnessed by\u00c2\u00a0Arya\u00c2\u00a0during her escape.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater on, after receiving a raven from Walder Frey with news of the massacre, Tywin summons Tyrion who finds his father in the company of an overjoyed Joffrey along with his mother, [[Varys]] and [[Pycelle]]. Tyrion reads the letter, at first not knowing what it meant, but Joffrey bluntly tells him the news that Robb and his mother were dead, and asks Pycelle to write back to Lord Frey to thank him and command him to send him Robb's head, in order to serve it to Sansa at his wedding feast. After a brief altercation between Joffrey and Tywin, the king is escorted to his chambers and Tyrion is left alone with Tywin, revealing his knowledge of Tywin's involvement in the massacre by promising Walder Frey and Roose Bolton protection from the outrage that is soon to come. Tywin justifies this by asking Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0how it was more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle or a dozen at dinner, and that he did it to end the war and protect their family. After their conversation ended bitterly,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion immediately returned to a tearful Sansa who had discovered the news of her mother and brother's deaths as well.\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\n[[File:Dwarf_Robb.png|thumb|left|An offensive reenactment of the War of the Five Kings during Joffrey's wedding feast boasts an intentionally tasteless depiction of Robb, played by a dwarf.]]\nEmotionally crushed by the deaths of Robb and Catelyn (the only family she had left), Sansa refuses to eat despite pleas from Shae. When Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0attempts to comfort her, she\u00c2\u00a0reveals to him that she can no longer sleep, but instead lies awake all night thinking about how her mother and brother died, having learned that the Freys had sewn Grey Wind's head onto Robb's decapitated corpse and later flung Catelyn's corpse into the Trident to rot. Tyrion laments that he didn't know Robb personally, but that he seemed like a good, honorable man.\n\nHaving also learned of Robb's death, Jon Snow confides to [[Samwell Tarly]] about the last time he saw his brother and how he had been jealous of Robb his whole life for the way his father looked at him, being his trueborn son, something Jon wanted for himself. He adds that even though Robb was better than him at everything when they were young, Jon couldn't hate him even though he wanted to.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt the wedding feast of King Joffrey and [[Margaery Tyrell]], Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] briefly consoles Sansa about the Red Wedding, noting that despite it being a time of war, it was still horrid to murder someone in such a disgusting manner, and at a wedding no less, even though ironically Olenna committed a similar crime only moments later by poisoning and subsequently murdering Joffrey at his own wedding feast. Later on in the feast, King Joffrey offers a mock reenactment of the War of the Five Kings with [[dwarf]] performers (an insult to Tyrion). One [[Dwarf 4|dwarf]] wears a fake wolf head over his head and constantly yells &quot;I'm the King in the North!&quot;, only to end up &quot;beheaded&quot; by the [[Dwarf 1|dwarf]] portraying Joffrey. Much to Sansa's disgust and heartache, the dwarf Joffrey then simulates having intercourse with the decapitated &quot;wolf head&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Personality": "Robb has a keen sense of honor and justice, which he received from his father. He is fair, caring, and will do anything to keep his family safe. Unlike\u00c2\u00a0[[Roose Bolton]], one of his central bannermen, Robb sees no reason for torture, cruelty, or unnecessary executions and treats his prisoners of war well and justly. He does not wish for violence or war and does his best to limit the deaths and casualties on both sides.\n\n\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Robb has a surprisingly keen mind for warfare and strategy, a trait that takes\u00c2\u00a0[[Tywin Lannister]]\u00c2\u00a0completely by surprise, who saw Robb as a stupid child who hadn't the slightest idea of the violence of war and after his first taste of battle would &quot;run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.&quot; The Lannisters were quite surprised when Robb led a stunning surprise attack in the Battle of the Whispering Wood to crush the western half of the Lannister armies under Jaime. Tywin also did not expect Robb to have the determination to send hundreds of his own men to their deaths in a feint to the east.\n\nRobb is very much his father's son, but this means that he has not only his father's strengths but his father's weaknesses. Like his father, Robb lacks proper political skills and has a tendency to put honor before reason. He married a political nobody out of love, needlessly spurning a badly needed political alliance with the Freys. Robb also put honor before pragmatic political needs when he executed Lord Rickard Karstark for treason and murder, costing him the Karstark contingent from his army. Like most Northerners, Robb is more proficient as a warrior than as a politician and court maneuverer. Much like Robert Baratheon before him, Robb Stark is an excellent warrior and military commander but a bad politician.\n\n"}, "title": "Robb Stark"}
