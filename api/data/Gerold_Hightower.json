He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it starts. Ser Gerold Hightower was a [[knight]] of [[House Hightower]] and the [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Kingsguard]] under [[Aerys II Targaryen]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Gerold Hightower was known as &quot;the White Bull&quot; for his immense strength. He was Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the brief reign of King Jaehaerys II and then under King Aerys II.\n\nGerold Hightower, similarly to [[Barristan Selmy]] and [[Arthur Dayne]], was blindly loyal to the Mad King, no matter how cruel and bloodthirsty Aerys was. He is present when Aerys [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|executes]] [[Rickard Stark]] and [[Brandon Stark (Son of Rickard)|his son]]. He notices that [[Jaime Lannister]] disapproves of the unjust atrocity and tells him &quot;You swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge him&quot;.\n\n", "Biography": "===[[Season 4]]===\n[[File:BookOfBrothersDayne.jpg|thumb|300px|Ser Arthur's and Ser Gerold's entries in the Book of Brothers]]\nSer Gerold Hightower's entry in ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'' mentions several events of his life.
