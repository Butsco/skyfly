It is the largest of the nine major regions of the continent, almost equal in size to the other eight combined. &lt;!--I have commented this out because it has been challenged and a source asked for: &quot;However, due to its harsh climate it has one of the smallest populations of any major region in the Seven Kingdoms, and is the most sparsely populated.&quot; It should not be restored to the article without adding a source. [[User:Opark 77]]--&gt; \n\nAccording to legend, the [[Kingdom of the North]] was established eight thousand years ago by [[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Bran the Builder]], the founder of House Stark, who constructed [[the Wall]] as a shield against the possible return of the [[White Walkers]].  The North is the only region where the [[First Men]] were able to resist the [[Andal Invasion]], six thousand years before the [[War of the Five Kings]].  As a result the North is the only region of Westeros in which the [[Northerner|ethnic]] makeup is predominantly First Men, and the only region where the culture, customs, and traditions of the First Men still predominate. Among these is the belief that the man who passes the sentence of death must swing the sword himself.  In particular, the religion of the First Men, the worship of the [[Old Gods of the Forest]], is still the dominant faith in the North. The [[Faith of the Seven]] introduced into southern Westeros by the [[Andals]] has found little foothold in the North. As a result, warriors from the North are not &quot;knights&quot;, because &quot;[[knighthood]]&quot; is a code of values associated with the Faith of the Seven.  However, mounted warriors are still an honored and esteemed military asset in the North, so that while northmen like [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] may not carry the title &quot;Ser&quot;, Northern cavalry are functionally equivalent to mounted knights.  \n\n[[Bastard]]s born in the North are given the surname '''Snow'''. People of the North are known as '''[[Northmen]]''' (or Northerners), and, derogatorily as '''wolves''', in reference to the sigil of House Stark.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n* [http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/map/ HBO Viewer's Guide]\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the North is an area vast in size but relatively light in population. The North, due to its location, is particularly badly affected during the long winters, with thousands of people killed and famine not an uncommon occurrence due to the inability to raise crops for years on end, outside of special greenhouses and castles built on or near hot springs, like Winterfell, or volcanic vents, like the Dreadfort of House Bolton.\n\nThe people of the North, popularly called &quot;northmen&quot; or &quot;notherners&quot;, are known as a hardy, tough breed who hold the comforts of the warm, &quot;soft&quot; south in disdain. They worship the old gods of the forest, and the &quot;new gods&quot; of the Andals have made little headway in the North. With a few exceptions, the warriors of the North refuse to take holy orders and thus cannot become [[knights]].\n\nSome of the northmen live in remote, distant areas where they act little more as clans and tribes of savage warriors. Even these remote folk are vassals of the Starks, however, and are allowed to maintain their own ways and traditions as long as they remain loyal to Winterfell - which most of them usually do, as the Starks have a history of being just and honorable rulers. The Starks treated the mountain clans with respect by referring to them as if they were small-scale noble Houses, i.e. calling them &quot;House Wull&quot; and &quot;House Norrey&quot;, instead of dismissively thinking of them as lowly &quot;clans&quot;.\n\n", "Geography": "\nThe borders of the North are held to be the sea to the west and east, [[the Wall]] to the north and the hills and bogs of the Neck to the south. Greywater Watch and its ruling house, House Reed, are the southern-most noble family owing fealty to Winterfell.\n\nThe climate of the North, though harsh overall, varies from cool (maritime) temperate around the Neck, to cold temperate around Winterfell, and to subarctic at the Wall. The lands south of Winterfell leading to the Neck are almost as fertile as the Riverlands to the south, and are the most agriculturally productive region of the North.  The Neck itself is filled with swamps.  Snowfall generally increases as one moves north along the Kingsroad.\n\n===Castles===\n* [[File:Bolton mini shield.png|30px]] [[Winterfell]], the ancient seat of [[House Stark]], currently occupied by House Bolton.\n** [[File:Mormont mini shield.png|30px]] [[Bear Island]], the seat of [[House Mormont]].\n** [[File:Cerwyn mini shield.png|30px]] [[Castle Cerwyn]], the seat of [[House Cerwyn]].\n** [[Deepwood Motte]], the seat of [[House Glover]].\n** [[File:Bolton mini shield.png|30px]] [[The Dreadfort]], the seat of [[House Bolton]].\n** [[Greywater Watch]], the seat of [[House Reed]], the southernmost house sworn to Winterfell.\n** [[File:Hornwood mini shield.png|30px]][[Hornwood|The Hornwood]], the seat of [[House Hornwood]].\n** [[File:Karstark mini shield.png|30px]] [[Karhold]], the seat of [[House Karstark]].\n** [[File:Umber mini shield.png|30px]] [[Last Hearth]], the seat of [[House Umber]].\n** [[Torrhen's Square]], the seat of [[House Tallhart]].\n** [[White Harbor]], the seat of [[House Manderly]], the principal city and port of the North.\n** [[Flint's Finger]]\n** [[Moat Cailin]], a ruined castle at the northern edge of [[the Neck]].\n** [[Barrowton]], a holdfast in the [[Barrowlands]], seat of [[House Dustin]].\n** [[Oldcastle]]\n** [[Ramsgate]], a holdfast at the mouth of [[Broken Branch]].\n** [[Widow's Watch]]\n** [[File:Forrester mini shield.png|30px]] [[Ironrath]], the seat of [[House Forrester]], vassals of [[House Glover]].\n** [[File:Whitehill mini shield2.png|30px]] [[Highpoint]], the seat of [[House Whitehill]], vassals of House Bolton.\n\n\n===Regions===\n*[[The Neck]]\n*[[The Rills]], ruled by [[House Ryswell]]\n*[[Cape Kraken]]\n*The [[Barrowlands]]\n*[[Stony Shore]]\n*[[Sea Dragon Point]]\n*[[Wolfswood]]\n*[[The Grey Cliffs]]\n\n===Islands===\n*[[Bear Island]]\n* [[Skagos]]\n* [[Skane]]\n\n====Coastal Areas====\n*[[Bay of Ice]]\n*[[Bay of Seals]]\n*[[Blazewater Bay]]\n*[[The Bite]]\n\n===Rivers and lakes===\n*[[White Knife]]\n*[[Broken Branch]]\n*[[Weeping Water]]\n*The [[Last River]]\n*[[Long Lake]]\n\n"}, "title": "The North"}
