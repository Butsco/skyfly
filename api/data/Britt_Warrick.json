He and two other soldiers move onto Forrester\u00c2\u00a0land and kill Gared Tuttle's sister, as well as mortally wound his father. Gared soon arrives at the scene after escaping the Red Wedding, and upon seeing his dying father, attacks Britt and the other two men with [[Gregor Forrester]]'s sword. Britt quickly disarms him and commands his companions to kill the squire, but Gared manages to kill one or both of them depending on the player's choices. Britt then flees the scene on horseback, swearing that Gared will hang for his actions.\n\nBritt later accompanies [[Ludd Whitehill]] to [[Ironrath]] to demand justice for Gared's killings, and tells Lord [[Ethan Forrester|Ethan]] that the squire attacked him and his men for no reason.\u00c2\u00a0He is last seen scowling at Ethan as the Whitehills leave the Forrester stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Iron From Ice]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n===&quot;[[The Sword in the Darkness]]&quot;===\nBritt first appears in this episode when Frostfinger is announcing the new recruits at The Wall. He and Gared have a brief verbal confrontation being separated by Frostfinger. \n\nAtop of the wall during Gared's shift, Britt joins him after leaving the elevator and attempts to taunt and infuriate him. Whether Gared is enraged or not the two then fight using several weapons at their disposal. He comments that if Gared's father could fight like him he would still be alive and the fight inevitably leads to Britt being severally maimed by Gared. Britt is last seen by Finn either bleeding to death, being finished off by Gared or being kicked off the wall.\n\n"}, "title": "Britt Warrick"}
