In a world where dragons once stalked the skies, there may be some kernel of truth behind the legends, which were later exaggerated to make Nagga big enough to drown entire islands. On the other hand, &quot;Nagga's Bones&quot;, the ruins of the Grey King's old hall, still exist and were used as the site where kingsmoots were held to elect the new King of the [[Iron Islands]] (before the kingship became hereditary). Descriptions of Nagga's Bones are vague: according to legend it was made using the massive bones of Nagga as pillars, but the narration doesn't make it clear if these are just pillars of rock that resemble bones, or if &quot;Nagga's Bones&quot; actually are the remaining fossilized bones of some immense animal.\n\n"}, "title": "Nagga"}
