It lies within the [[Bay of Ice]] on the western coast of [[the North]]. [[Rodrik Stark]] is alleged to have won control of the island in a wrestling match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/bear-island/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Bear Island entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] of the [[Night's Watch]] was born on Bear Island, as was his disgraced son, [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]]. Following Jorah's disgrace, his aunt [[Maege\u00c2\u00a0Mormont|Maege&amp;nbsp;Mormont]] (Jeor's\u00c2\u00a0younger sister) became Lady of Bear Island.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "According to legend, in ancient times, Bear Island was ruled by House Woodfoot, who were wiped out when the [[ironborn]] conquered the island. [[Rodrik Stark]], the [[King in the North]] then, won Bear Island as a reward for triumphing in a wrestling match with an ironborn king. He then gave the island to House Mormont to rule.\n\nBear Island is somewhat poor, home mostly to woodsmen, crofters and fisherfolk, as well as the bears that give the island its name. The seat of the Mormonts is a huge wooden hall, defended by an earthern palisade. There is a [[Warrior women|warrior woman tradition]] on Bear Island, for the women who defend their children and homes from [[wildling]] raiders from the [[Frozen Shore]] (and in past times the ironborn) while their husbands and fathers are away on fishing boats or working the fields.\n\n"}, "title": "Bear Island"}
