They are supposedly the size of hounds.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels several accounts about the Others - the name used in the novels to refer to the White Walkers - speak of giant ice spiders employed by them to hunt down their victims. Other accounts mention the Others actually riding the spiders.\n\nAs of the fifth novel, ice spiders have not yet appeared. Within the narrative, Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly remark that they used to think White Walkers and wights were the stuff of legends, but now they know otherwise. Thus they speculate that the brief mentions of &quot;giant ice spiders&quot; in the old myths might be a real creature that the White Walkers will attack them with, though they also point out that they haven't seen any...yet.\n\n"}, "title": "Ice spiders"}
