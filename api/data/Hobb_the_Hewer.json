Hobb locked his legs around the beasts neck and continued to rain blows on the dragons skull. The seventh blow (known as [[the Stranger]]'s blow) ended Shrykos' life.\n\nSome tales also claim Hobb slew the dragon [[Syrax]], however most historians concur this is highly unlikely. It is unknown if Hobb survived or not, he most likely was slain when the Dragonpit collapsed.\n\n", "Biography": "Hobb participated in the [[Storming of the Dragonpit]], in which he slew the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Shrykos]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Dragons (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Hobb the Hewer"}
