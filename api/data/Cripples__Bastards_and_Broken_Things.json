There are no city walls, but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses. [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] is annoyed that Drogo has been taking 'his' army in the wrong direction. Later, he bathes with [[Doreah]] and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[dragons]] and his own destiny. He recites the names of several dragons, and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at King's Landing, but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons, reminding him that they are dead. He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence.\n\nViserys is enraged when [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] sends Doreah with an invite for him to dine with her, as he interprets this as his sister ''commanding'' him to come. He drags Doreah into Daenerys' tent, and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him. He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from [[Pentos]], having refused to dress like a Dothraki, whom he regards as savages. He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a Dothraki. Daenerys retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle. In his anger, Viserys tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her, but this time she fights back, hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt. She tells an astounded Viserys that she is the Khal's wife, and is carrying his child (and by implication, Viserys is nothing to the Dothraki), and warns that if he raises a hand against her again, he will lose his hands. Later, Daenerys confides in [[Jorah Mormont|Mormont]] her realization that Viserys will never become [[Iron Throne|King of Westeros]]. He is so weak and ineffectual that he couldn't command an army even if Drogo gave him one.\n\n===In the Seven Kingdoms===\n[[File:Tyrion and Bran 1x04.png|thumb|Tyrion speaks with Bran.]]In [[Winterfell]], [[Bran Stark]] has a nightmare in which he sees a [[three-eyed raven]], sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the Stark crypts. He wakes up to find his [[Direwolves|direwolf]] [[Summer]] by his side. [[Theon Greyjoy]] summons [[Hodor]], the castle's dim-witted stableboy, who can only say the word &quot;Hodor&quot;, to help carry Bran down to the great hall, where [[Robb Stark]] is hosting a meeting with [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Yoren]], both traveling down from [[the Wall]] to [[King's Landing]] together. Robb very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the Watch, silently letting Tyrion know he is not invited to stay at Winterfell.\n\nWhen Bran arrives, Tyrion sympathizes with Bran for being a cripple, which annoys Bran, as does asking him if he likes to ride, but Tyrion simply says it is the truth, no less so for being a hard truth. He gives the [[House Stark|Starks]] the design of a saddle which will allow Bran to ride even in his current state. He does it to repay Bran's [[Jon Snow|half-brother]]'s friendship and because he has a weakness for, &quot;Cripples, bastards and broken things.&quot; Due to this kindness, Robb says he can stay, but Tyrion says he would prefer the brothel in town. While preparing to leave the castle, Theon comes to Tyrion and rather condescendingly sends him off, recommending the prostitute Ros at the brothel. Tyrion asks Theon why Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] was not present to receive him and concludes that Catelyn is not in Winterfell. He also taunts Theon about how the son of the ferocious [[Balon Greyjoy]] has been reduced to playing lackey in Winterfell to his captors, which infuriates Theon.\n\n[[Image:Jon, Sam and Pyp.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Samwell Tarly]] joins the new recruits at [[Castle Black]].]]\n\nAt [[Castle Black]] a new recruit for the [[Night's Watch]] has arrived: [[Samwell Tarly]], the son of the famous Lord [[Randyll Tarly]]. Samwell is fat, soft and pampered, and in his first practice fight does dismally. Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] has no time for his weakness. He directs the other recruits to attack 'Ser Piggy', but Jon Snow finds this cruel and unfair, and takes pity on Sam and fends off the attackers. Thorne tries to turn it into a game, ordering three trainees take on Sam's protector (taunting Jon that he has found a new Lady love), but Jon nevertheless fends them all off. While Samwell is grateful, he is also self-deprecating, claiming to be a coward and craven, to Jon's astonishment. No one admits to being a coward, and Grenn says that they shouldn't even be seen talking to him.\n\nIn the [[Red Keep]] of [[King's Landing]], [[Sansa Stark]] visits the [[Great Hall (Red Keep)|Great Hall]], where the [[Iron Throne]] sits. She and Septa [[Mordane]] discuss the expectation that Sansa will have to provide [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] with an heir. Sansa thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters, along with her belief Joffrey is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over Lady's death.\n\n[[File:Small Council.png|thumb|The small council meets.]]During a meeting of the [[small council]], Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] learns that the forthcoming [[tournament]] to celebrate his appointment is seeing the city swell with visitors, and has already resulted in a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race. He tells Littlefinger that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards, as well as giving twenty of his own men to [[Janos Slynt]]'s command, until the tournament is over. After the meeting Eddard talks to Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] about [[Jon Arryn]]'s last few weeks. Pycelle said he did all he could to save Jon Arryn, but the illness was sudden and severe. He recalls that shortly before his sudden illness, Arryn had borrowed [[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms|a truly boring book about the lineages]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], and his last words were, &quot;The seed is strong.&quot;\n\nSam joins Jon on [[the Wall]] for sentry duty, even though he says his eyesight is weak, he is afraid of heights, and can't take the cold. Jon asks why he joined the Night's Watch as he is afraid of everything. Sam tells him that on his eighteenth [[nameday]] his father offered him a choice. Sam was a man and his heir, but he was not skilled at combat, he was unworthy of his name and birthright. Samwall's father forced him to join the Night's Watch, and told him that if he refused, he would arrange a &quot;hunting trip&quot; with his son in the woods, and implied that Sam would be killed in a way that looked accidental. Jon is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a [[Bastardy|bastard]]. Sam knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad.\n\n[[File:Eddard and Petyr 1x04.png|thumb|Petyr talks with Eddard.]]In King's Landing, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] meets with Eddard and suggests that he keeps his investigation into Jon Arryn's death lower in profile. He also gives Eddard some interesting intelligence: Jon Arryn's squire has been [[Knighthood|knighted]] and will fight in the forthcoming Hand's tourney. Eddard decides that Littlefinger may be more trustworthy than first he thought. His investigation leads him to a smithy in the city, where he meets master smith [[Tobho Mott]] and his apprentice [[Gendry]], whose work Jon Arryn was also apparently interested in. Eddard realizes that Gendry is one of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s bastard sons, but can't work out why Jon Arryn would be interested in this: Robert has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them.\n\nIn the keep, one of Eddard's retinue, [[Jory Cassel]] talks to Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], who is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside, flaunting his dishonorable treatment of Jaime's sister in his face. He and Jory reminisce about the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], in which they both fought for King Robert's forces to put down an attempt by [[Balon Greyjoy]] (Theon's father) to secede the [[Iron Islands]] from the rest of the realm.\n\n[[File:Grenn-yield.png|thumb|Grenn yields to Samwell.]]At the Wall, Jon talks to the other recruits and convinces most of them to go easy on Sam. [[Rast]] refuses, saying that if Ser Alliser orders him to fight Ser Piggy he will slice himself of a rasher of pork. So Jon goes to Rast's bed that night and uses his direwolf [[Ghost]] to intimidate Rast into playing along. The next day, no one will fight Sam. Grenn (really badly acting) takes a very weak blow from Sam, falls, and yields. Later, when Jon and Sam are in the mess hall, they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman. Sam has no success with girls, and Jon will not risk siring a child that will have the life of a [[Bastardy|bastard]] like himself. A furious Alliser Thorne comes in and tells Jon that this charity won't help Sam harden up to survive the winter that is coming. He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the wall that ended in cannibalism.\n\nThe tournament begins and Sansa watches from the stands. Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], the elder brother of [[Sandor Clegane]], the Hound, takes the field. His first joust is with Ser [[Hugh of the Vale]], Jon Arryn's former squire. However, the friendly joust turns nasty and Gregor kills Ser Hugh &quot;by accident&quot;, with a splinter of the lance impaling his neck. Littlefinger sits next to Sansa, and remarks that she and Joffrey have had a lover's quarrel (as Joffrey is still giving her the cold shoulder). Baelish then tells Sansa that Gregor, the &quot;Mountain That Rides&quot;, has a fell reputation: he pushed his little brother Sandor's face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young, burning him severely. Littlefinger recommends that Sansa not spread that story around.\n\nAt the [[Crossroads Inn]], Catelyn and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], on their way home to Winterfell, are enjoying the hospitality of the innkeeper and, more reluctantly, the attempts by the troubadour [[Marillion]] to ingratiate himself with them. (He is doing a poor job: when they ask him if he has ever traveled in the north, he says they don't appreciate music there, just the howling of wolves). They are surprised when Tyrion Lannister and Yoren arrive. When told there aren't any rooms, he holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him. Quickly Tyrion gains the favor of a [[Mercenary|sellsword]], [[Bronn]], who agrees to give his room to Tyrion. Marillion draws the attention of Tyrion to their table, by offering to serenade him while he eats, singing of his father's military victories. Tyrion says nothing would more likely ruin his appetite, but as he is turning away, he recognizes Catelyn and is surprised at this meeting by chance. In return Catelyn tells the stunned inn that Tyrion tried to murder her son Bran twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king's justice. The inn is located in [[the Riverlands]], in the territory controlled by [[Hoster Tully|her father]], so the knights present owe him their fealty. Tyrion finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords, and in Catelyn's custody.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Lord [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Mark Addy]] as King [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Emilia Clarke]] as Princess [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\n* [[Harry Lloyd]] as Prince [[Viserys Targaryen]]\n* [[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Maisie Williams]] as [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Richard Madden]] as [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as [[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Jack Gleeson]] as Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n* [[Rory McCann]] as [[Sandor Clegane]]\n* and [[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n\n'''Also Starring'''\n*[[Jason Momoa]] as [[Khal Drogo]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n\n'''Guest starring'''\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Maester [[Luwin]]\n* [[Conleth Hill]] as Lord [[Varys]]\n* [[Jerome Flynn]] as [[Bronn]]\n* [[Owen Teale]] as Ser [[Alliser Thorne]]\n* [[Jamie Sives]] as [[Jory Cassel]]\n* [[Ron Donachie]] as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n* [[Francis Magee]] as [[Yoren]]\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Lord Commander [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Dominic Carter]] as Commander [[Janos Slynt]]\n* [[Julian Glover]] as Grand Maester [[Pycelle]]\n* [[Gethin Anthony]] as Lord [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Emun Elliott]] as [[Marillion]]\n* [[Susan Brown]] as Septa [[Mordane]]\n* [[Margaret John]] as [[Old Nan]]\n* [[John Bradley]] as [[Samwell Tarly]]\n* [[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]]\n* [[Josef Altin]] as [[Pypar]]\n* [[Luke McEwan]] as [[Rast]]\n* [[Conan Stevens]] as Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]\n* [[Amrita Acharia]] as [[Irri]]\n* [[Roxanne McKee]] as [[Doreah]]\n* [[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n* [[Jefferson Hall]] as Ser [[Hugh]] of the Vale\n* [[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Gendry]]\n* [[Andrew Wilde]] as [[Tobho Mott]]\n* [[Callum Wharry]] as Prince [[Tommen Baratheon]]\n* [[Aimee Richardson]] as Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n* [[Kevin Keenan]] as [[Kurleket]]\n* [[Patrick Ryan]] as [[Knight of House Frey]]\n* [[Ryan McKenna]] as Ser [[Willis Wode]]\n* [[Susie Kelly]] as [[Masha Heddle]]\n'''Uncredited'''\n* [[Eugene Simon]]\u00c2\u00a0as\u00c2\u00a0[[Lancel Lannister]]\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n* [[Conan Stevens]] lobbied for the role of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], even going as far as auditioning for the pilot as Khal [[Drogo]], knowing he wouldn't get it, but to put his name before the casting directors.\n* Lord Commander [[Barristan Selmy]], Joffrey Baratheon, Myrcella Baratheon, Tommen Baratheon and Khal Drogo appear only briefly and do not have any lines of dialogue.\n\n", "Notes": "* The\u00c2\u00a0episode takes its name from the phrase spoken by Tyrion.\n* First mention of the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].\n* First mention of [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-beyond-the-Wall]].\n* First mention of Lord [[Walder Frey]], Lord [[Jonos Bracken]] and [[Shella Whent|Lady Whent]] of [[Harrenhal]].\n* The scene with Viserys and Doreah in the bath discussing dragons was filmed for the previous episode but moved to this episode for timing reasons.

This surprises Kit Harington, who assumed it was one of the scenes shot in Malta.\n* Bryan Cogman's take on the 'sexposition' scenes was that Doreah's line from the second episode, &quot;Men like to talk when they are happy,&quot; is accurate, and the sex scenes expose characters when they are vulnerable and thus more open to show their true natures.\n* The episode is heavy on establishing backstory and mythology, which again was not planned in the writing but happened to turn out that way.\n* The small council scenes were among Bryan Cogman's favorite. They were filmed very close together over a period of several days.\n* Bryan Cogman wrote all of the legible pages in the ''Lineages'' book, to Kit Harington's surprise.\n* The scene with Sam and Jon on top of the Wall was filmed on a hot day in the Paint Hall, making it hard for the actors to pretend they were freezing.\n* Both Kit Harington and Bryan Cogman are huge fans of both ''[[wikipedia:Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:The Wire|The Wire]]'', so they particularly enjoyed the scenes between Eddard (Sean Bean played Richard Sharpe in ''Sharpe'') and Littlefinger (Aiden Gillen played Mayor Thomas Carcetti in ''The Wire'').\n* During Sam and Jon's exchange in the messhall, Kit Harington's idea was to jump over the table to playfully hit Sam. However, he 'totally stacked it' and ended up on the floor. The director drily suggested just shooting it as it was written.\n* Alliser Thorne's speech about being beyond the Wall is referred to by Bryan Cogman as the &quot;Robert Shaw in ''[[wikipedia:Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''&quot; scene. It was written to give Owen Teale more material and also to establish Thorne's character as more multifaceted than it first appears.\n* Kit Harington and Bradley John-West got stuck in the Castle Black lift for well over an hour when it suffered a mechanical failure. Kit started getting worried when a nurse was called on-set just in case they suffered injuries.\n* Bryan Cogman and Kit Harington are both fans of Sansa's character development and feel she gets a bad rap from some parts of the fanbase.\n* The tourney scene was much larger and more elaborate in the script, more like the scene in the book, but had to be trimmed back. Amongst the problems was a very tight schedule for filming the tourney scenes for both the fourth and fifth episodes which prevented too many shorts or montages.\n* Bryan Cogman acknowledges that it would have been better to have had Sandor tell Sansa his backstory in person (as in the books) but there were production reasons this was not possible. He reassures fans that the Sandor/Sansa subplot will still unfold, only differently to in the books.\n* The scene between Eddard and Cersei in the Hand's quarters was the first scene filmed for the series (aside from the pilot).\n* Cogman preferred not to change George R.R. Martin's dialogue or writing unless absolutely necessary for production, money or time reasons. His approach was, &quot;Why mess with perfection?&quot;\n* The scene where Catelyn arrests Tyrion was Michelle Fairley's audition piece.\n\n", "Appearances": ":''Main: [[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things/Appearances]]''\n===First===\n*Commander [[Janos Slynt]]\n*Ser [[Hugh]] of the Vale\n*[[Gendry]]\n*[[Tobho Mott]]\n*[[Marillion]]\n*[[Masha Heddle]]\n*[[Bronn]]\n*Ser [[Willis Wode]]\n*[[Kurleket]]\n*[[Knight of House Frey]]\n*[[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n\n===Deaths===\n*Ser [[Hugh]] of the Vale\n\n"}, "title": "Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things"}
