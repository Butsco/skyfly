He is played by starring cast member [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming (episode)|series premiere]]. Bran Stark is a noble boy living with his family in [[Winterfell]]. He lost the use of his legs after being pushed out of a tower window. He relies on the servant [[Hodor]] to aid his mobility. He has had prophetic dreams.\n\nBran adopted the [[direwolf]] [[Summer]] and they have forged a strong connection. He is able to see through the direwolf's eyes while he sleeps, as Bran is a [[Warg]]: a person who possesses the magical ability to enter the minds of animals and people. Bran is also blessed with the magical power of [[greensight]], which gives him prophetic visions in his dreams.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels Bran is seven years old when the action begins. He has a love of climbing, and has been known to climb the walls of [[Winterfell]] and go exploring its ancient nooks and crannies. He dreams of one day being a great knight, but he is also fascinated by magic. Before his disability, he shows some skills with a sword when Robert Baratheon visits Winterfell by befriending and sparring with [[Tommen Baratheon]].\n\nAn interesting difference between involving Bran's appearance is that in the books, he is described as having red-auburn hair like his mother, while on the series he has brown hair. [[Robb Stark]]'s hair was also similarly darkened for the television series, as it was described as being the similarly reddish in the books. It is likely this was done to increase the contrast between [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and the rest of her family, who are portrayed as being very much more traditional Northmen in character as well as appearance. Sansa was heavily influenced by her mother thus giving Sansa her mother's auburn hair helps color-code this visually, and similarly, giving Bran his father's dark hair helped color-code how deeply his father influenced him.\n\nIn real life, &quot;Bran&quot; is the word for &quot;raven/crow&quot; in several [[wikipedia:Celtic languages|Celtic languages]] (Welsh, Cornish, Breton, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bran &quot;Bran&quot; on Wiktionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Westeros is loosely analogous to the [[wikipedia:British Isles|Britain]], the [[First Men]] and their [[Old Gods of the Forest|Old Gods]] are loosely analogous to the original [[wikipedia:Celts|Celtic inhabitants]] of Britain who worshiped druidic nature gods, but were later driven to the fringe of the island by invading peoples (i.e. the [[Andals]] are like the [[wikipedia:Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxons]]). It is unknown if George R.R. Martin intentionally picked the name &quot;Bran&quot; knowing it is the Celtic word for &quot;Crow&quot;, but it does neatly associate with Bran and his visions of the three-eyed crow.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "On the [[Season 1]] Blu-ray, Bran narrates [[Complete Guide to Westeros]] videos on '''&quot;[[The Children of the Forest, the First Men, and the Andals]]&quot;''', '''&quot;[[The Age of Heroes (Complete Guide to Westeros)|The Age of Heroes]]&quot;''', '''&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New (Complete Guide to Westeros)|The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;''' and '''&quot;[[House Stark (Complete Guide to Westeros)|House Stark]]&quot;'''. On the Season 3 Blu-ray, he narrates [[Histories &amp; Lore]] video &quot;'''[[Wargs and the Sight (Histories &amp; Lore)|Wargs and the Sight]]'''&quot;.\n\nBran Stark does not appear in [[Season 5]].  As [[David Benioff]] explained, Bran simply caught up with his material from the most recent book, and his arrival at the cave of the three-eyed raven was a good stopping point, so it made more sense to just take a year off from his storyline to focus on other sub-plots which are also competing for time:\n\n:&quot;The fact is, even though we\u00e2&euro;&trade;re making changes to the books and adapting as necessary, we\u00e2&euro;&trade;re trying to keep the various storylines the same [as the books] and trying to keep them roughly [chronologically] parallel. And [in Season 4] we caught up to the end of Bran's storyline [in George R.R. Martin\u00e2&euro;&trade;s most recent book, ''A Dance with Dragons''] last year. So if we pushed him forward this season, then he's way ahead of where the other characters are...Like, it would be far less interesting, after ''The Empire Strikes Back'' to have an hour-long movie in between ''Empire'' and ''Return of the Jedi'' where Luke is training, it's so much cooler to cut from end of ''Empire'' to begging of ''Return'', where he's become the Jedi.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/13/game-thrones-bran-season-6 ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Abilities": "Bran Stark is one of a few characters known to possess [[Magic|magical]] abilities.\n\n*[[Greensight]] - also called simply &quot;The Sight&quot;, is the ability to receive prophetic visions, starting off in the form of dreams.\n*[[Warg]] - Bran is a warg, a human who can send his consciousness into the mind of an animal, to see through its eyes and control its body as if it were his own.  [[Jojen Reed]] states that this is a different though related ability to the Sight.  Though he still needs training, Bran is inherently a very powerful warg, even able to enter the mind of another human (albeit a mentally handicapped one, [[Hodor]]), something the wargs among the wildlings are unable and unwilling to do.  Bran has already become skilled at entering the mind of his direwolf [[Summer]], in which he is a dangerous fighter able to dispatch several wildlings or wights.  \n**Warging with a [[Heart tree]], a [[Weirwood]] with a face carved in it by the Children of the Forest, allows Bran to (combined with his Greensight) have vivid visions of past, present, and future events, including those far away from himself.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nJon, Bran and Robb.jpg|[[Robb Stark]] and [[Jon Snow]] watching Bran practice archery in &quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;.\nRobb, Bran and wolves.jpg|Robb and Bran find the [[direwolves]] in &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;.\nHouse Stark and retainers.jpg|Bran and his family await the arrival of the king in &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;.\nBran in the archway.jpg|Promotional image of Bran in Winterfell in &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;.\nBranandcat.png|[[Catelyn Stark]] tending to an unconscious Bran in &quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;.

The Starks find a litter of [[direwolf]] pups and Eddard reluctantly agrees to let his children adopt them because they are the symbol of their house. Bran eventually settles on naming his direwolf Summer. King [[Robert Baratheon]]'s party arrives at Winterfell, and Eddard agrees to act as the [[Hand of the King]].

Bran says that he would rather be dead, to Robb's distress.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Bran begins to have a recurring dream in which a [[three-eyed raven]] flies into the crypts of Winterfell. He is awoken to meet with [[Tyrion Lannister]], who has stopped at Winterfell on his way home. Out of his regard for [[Jon Snow]], Tyrion has designed a special saddle that will allow Bran to ride despite his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Bran takes a lesson on the sigils and mottos of the [[Great Houses]] from Maester [[Luwin]], who is confident that Tyrion's saddle will work. Luwin also suggests that Bran could learn to use a shortbow from horseback, in the manner of the [[Dothraki]].

Bran says farewell to Robb when he leads the Stark armies to war in response. He also tries unsuccessfully to reassure Rickon that Robb will return. He prays in the godswood for their safe return, and is joined by Osha (now a servant of Winterfell), who tells him that Robb's army is marching the wrong way and the true threat lies to the north, [[Beyond the Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Bran.png|thumb|left|Bran and Osha in Winterfell.]]\nBran tells Osha of his dreams featuring the Three-eyed raven as he rides on her shoulders, saying that he saw his father in the crypts. Osha is skeptical. Bran taunts her about her fear of the catacombs and eventually she agrees to take him down to the crypt. Bran recites the names of his deceased relatives as they pass them. They approach the place where Eddard was in Bran\u00e2&euro;&trade;s dream. There, they are startled by [[Shaggydog]] and [[Rickon]]. Rickon has also dreamt of their father in that spot. Osha and Bran go back to the surface and Osha attempts to soothe Bran\u00e2&euro;&trade;s worries about his father.

He discusses the dream with Maester Luwin who reassures him that magic has been absent from the world for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Bran dreams of the Three-eyed raven again and seeks advice from [[Osha]]. She questions him further and he reveals another dream about the sea flooding Winterfell and drowning Winterfell and its people, including Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]. She does not offer any explanation. Ser Rodrik brings news that [[Torrhen's Square]] has been besieged and Bran orders him to take the remaining garrison to relieve the siege.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Bran surrenders Winterfell.jpg|thumb|left|Bran surrenders Winterfell to Theon]]\nBran is awoken by [[Theon Greyjoy]], who tells him that he has seized Winterfell. Theon tells Bran that he should yield the castle to protect his people. Bran reluctantly complies with a public announcement. Rodrik is captured on his return from Torrhen's Square. He insults Theon, calling him a traitor to Eddard Stark, and spits at him. Theon is pressured to execute him by his men. Theon ignores Bran's pleas and carries out a botched execution. Osha tells Bran that his dream came true; the Iron Islands (represented as the sea in the dream) have come to Winterfell. Bran escapes with Osha's help. They are accompanied by his brother Rickon, their direwolves and Hodor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Bran and Rickon Alive.jpg|thumb|Bran and Rickon in the catacombs beneath Winterfell.]]\nThey flee as far as a nearby farm.

The [[Ironborn]] flee and the Starks emerge from the crypts to find that their home [[Sack of Winterfell|has been sacked]] and abandoned.

This is when he meets [[Jojen Reed]] and his sister, [[Meera Reed|Meera]]. Jojen possesses the &quot;the sight&quot;, the rare gift of seeing the past and present through his dreams, and is able to speak with Bran through their dreams. Jojen also saw the Three-eyed raven, who is apparently responsible for bringing the sight to them, and\u00c2\u00a0tells Bran he is a 'Warg', someone who can control the minds of animals.

They are walking through the woods and see the three-eyed raven again. Jojen advises Bran that he must follow the raven, and when he is confused, Jojen points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree. Bran begins to climb the tree that the raven has landed in but he soon becomes terrified, remembering the fall that crippled him when he was climbing a tower at Winterfell. He sees a vivid dream-memory of his mother Catelyn, repeating her warning in which she made him promise never to climb again - a promise which he broke, and thus indirectly led to the fall which crippled him. Bran is so terrified of the memory of Catelyn yelling at him that he falls off the tree. Bran and Jojen wake in their camp in the woods, disappointed that he could not follow the three-eyed raven.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:S03E6 - Bran.png|thumb|Bran solves a dispute between Osha and Meera.]]\nTensions rise at camp between Osha and Meera Reed before Bran diffuses the situation. Jojen Reed experiences a seizure while sleeping, and Meera explains they are caused by his visions. Jojen then tells Bran that in his vision he saw Jon Snow with the wildlings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Climb]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:S03E7 - Bran &amp; Jojen.png|thumb|left|Bran and Jojen listens to Osha's story.]]\nOn their way to the Wall, Bran Stark's party makes camp. Osha remains distrustful of Meera and Jojen Reed and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the Wall. Osha bluntly refuses to go, explaining that she lost her husband, who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her. She rages that none of them understand what lies [[beyond the Wall]] and that there is nothing left for men there. However, Bran agrees with Jojen, arguing that the raven has been waiting for him to find him since Bran fell from the tower.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:S03E9 - Bran.png|thumb|Bran wargs into Hodor's mind, calming him down.]]\nAfter seeking shelter in a [[Queenscrown|derelict windmill]] during a rainstorm, the group notices a band of wildlings chasing down a [[old man]]. The sounds of thunder terrify Hodor, who shouts out in panic. Fearing discovery, Jojen tells Bran to silence Hodor, who keeps panicking. Bran unintentionally uses his Warg powers to render Hodor unconscious. With the wildlings still outside, Jojen convinces Bran to Warg through Summer and Shaggydog outside, who then maul to death some of the wildlings. While in control of Summer and Shaggydog, Bran saw Jon Snow outside fighting the wildlings. After this, Bran insists that he must go beyond the Wall to find the raven. However, he wants Rickon to be safe, so he\u00c2\u00a0tells Osha to take his brother\u00c2\u00a0with her to the holdfast of [[Greatjon Umber]], a loyal bannerman of the Starks. Bran bids a tearful Rickon farewell, who leaves with Osha and Shaggydog, while Bran continues northward with Hodor, Summer and the Reed siblings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:S03E10 - Bran.png|thumb|left|Bran and the group go beyond the Wall.]]\nAt last, they make it to the Wall and stay overnight in the [[Nightfort]], an abandoned castle on the Wall that is rumored to be haunted. During the night, Jon Snow's fellow [[Night's Watch]] comrade [[Samwell Tarly]], with [[Gilly]] and her child, emerge from a secret passageway. Samwell, noticing the gigantic Hodor and Summer, realizes who Bran is and offers to take them to Castle Black, but Jojen tells Sam that they are going beyond the Wall, as no force in the realm of Westeros could withstand the threat posed by the White Walkers. Sam reluctantly shows them the secret sally port and gives them the obsidian blades found north of the Wall, which he earlier used to slay a White Walker. That night, Bran, the Reeds, Hodor and Summer finally pass beyond the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\n[[File:S04E2 - Bran &amp; Hodor.jpg|thumb|Bran about to warg with the Heart tree.]]\nBran, [[Hodor]], [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] and [[Meera Reed|Meera]]\u00c2\u00a0are north of the Wall and Bran is looking through [[Summer|Summer's]] eyes, now having the ability to look through\u00c2\u00a0him whenever\u00c2\u00a0he wants.

Karl refuses and just before he cuts Meera, Jon Snow and members of the\u00c2\u00a0[[Night's Watch]]\u00c2\u00a0attack the keep.\u00c2\u00a0[[Locke]], who really serves\u00c2\u00a0[[Roose Bolton]], searches for Bran and finds him and attempts to escape the keep with Bran. However, Bran\u00c2\u00a0[[warg]]s\u00c2\u00a0into Hodor, who escapes his binds and catches up to Locke. He lifts Locke off the ground and breaks his neck. Bran can see Jon and tries to crawl over to him to get his attention. He is about to reach him when Jojen\u00c2\u00a0arrives and intervenes, telling him that Jon will not let him search for the\u00c2\u00a0[[Three-eyed raven]]\u00c2\u00a0if he goes with Jon back to\u00c2\u00a0[[Castle Black]]. Bran agrees and prepares to leave.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Wights rise.png|thumb|left|Wights rise from the ground to kill Bran and company.]]Bran and his group eventually reach the giant weirwood tree on the hill, but are attacked by a group of [[wights]]. Jojen is fatally stabbed and Meera attempts to save him, but Jojen tells her to leave him for dead. They are helped by a [[Child of the Forest (The Children)|Child of the Forest]], who leads them into a cave after burning Jojen's body. She explains that the wights cannot enter, as the magic that reanimates them has no power there. She then leads them deep into the cave to the three-eyed raven, who is revealed to not be a bird but a very old man whose body is fused to the roots of the weirwood tree. Meera begins to tell him that Jojen has died and before she can finish the raven says that Jojen knew what would happen the moment he left, and went anyway. When Meera asks how he knows that, the raven says that he has been watching them for all of their lives with a thousand eyes and one. The raven tells Bran that the hour is late, and Bran replies that he did not want anyone to die for him. The raven states that Jojen died so that Bran could find what he lost. Bran asks if the raven will help him walk again. The raven answers that Bran will never walk again, but he will fly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Children]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Bran Stark"}
