She stars in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Sansa Stark]]. The show is her television debut. She was part of the initial starring cast and remains a member of the starring cast for the [[Season 2|second season]].\n\nRegarding her character, Turner said in ''The Sunday Times'' before the Season 4 premiere:\n\n:&quot;She's relatable to because she\u00e2&euro;&trade;s such a realistic character...I think she\u00e2&euro;&trade;s like young girls today \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; they read magazines, they look at models, they\u00e2&euro;&trade;ve got social media telling them how to act. That's who Sansa is. She's looked at the queen, she's looked at Margaery Tyrell, and she idolises them. All she wants is to become them. She\u00e2&euro;&trade;s like every 12-year-old girl who wants to be a celebrity \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; it's the same adolescence as everyone else, but a few hundred years ago. In an alternative universe. With dragons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/article1389051.ece], [http://fyeahsophieturner.tumblr.com/post/80500246728/sophie-turner-interviewed-in-the-sunday-times-complete]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTurner actually has &quot;naturally baby blonde hair&quot;, so her hair had to be dyed for Sansa's auburn (reddish brown) hair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed#3]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Starks have black hair, while the Tullys have auburn hair, and Sansa is stated in the books to take after her mother Catelyn Tully in appearance.  When Sansa flees to the Vale with Littlefinger, she dyes her hair black to hide her true identity (corresponding to the end of Season 4 in the TV series).  \n\nOn January 23, 2015, is was confirmed by director Brian Singer that Sophie will appear in ''X-Men: Apocalypse'' (which is set in the 1980s) as young Jean Grey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/x_men_apocalypse/news/1932631/weekly_ketchup_x-men_apocalypse_finds_its_jean_grey_storm_and_cyclops/&lt;/ref&gt;\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery widths=&quot;160&quot; spacing=&quot;small&quot;&gt;\nEsme Bianco, Sophie Turner &amp; Maisie Williams.jpg|Esme Bianco, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams during the filming of the [[Pilot episode]].\nsophie-turner-1387741738.jpg\nsophie-turner.jpg\nsophie-turner-1387738895.jpg\nsophie-turner-1387738934.jpg\nsophie-turner-at-another-me-photocall-in-rome_2.jpg\nsophie-turner-portraits-at-rome-film-festival-_1.jpg\nSophie+Turner+20th+Annual+Screen+Actors+Guild+xwDkfrbHIizl.jpg\nSOPHIE-TURNER-at-Olympus-Has-Fallen-Premiere-in-London-1.jpg\nSophie-Turner-sophie-turner-35061470-500-750.jpg\no-SOPHIE-TURNER-900.jpg\nBAFTA+Craft+Awards+Arrivals+wXSAKZxW3rgl.jpg\nSophie Turner and Zunni 1.png|Sophie Turner adopted Zunni, the Northern Inuit dog who played Sansa's direwolf, [[Lady]].\nSophie Turner and Zunni 2.png\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{WP|Sophie Turner (actress)|Sophie Turner}}\n*{{IMDb\n|# = 3849842}}\n*{{Twitter\n|# = SophieT}}\n*{{Instagram|# = sophie_789}}\n*[http://winter-is-coming.net/2011/03/interview-with-sophie-turner/ Interview with Sophie Turner at Winter is Coming.]\n*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BldjOuq5ssw Sophie Turner red carpet quotes]\n*[http://www.themarysue.com/sophie-turner-writes-slash-fic/ Sophie Turner describes her own ''The Real Housewives of Westeros'' crossover fanfic (video)]\n\n"}, "title": "Sophie Turner"}
