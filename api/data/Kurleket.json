He is traveling the Kingsroad following the Tourney of the Hand.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\nKurleket is drinking with companions at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] when [[Tyrion Lannister]] arrives on his way south. [[Catelyn Stark]] is also in the inn and Tyrion recognizes her. She turns to the [[knights]] from the [[Riverlands]] in the inn to help her to take Tyrion into custody, accusing him of attempting to murder her son [[Bran Stark]]. She asserts her origin as a daughter of [[House Tully]] and then tells the man of [[House Bracken]] that she recognizes the red stallion of [[House Bracken]] and says that her father Lord [[Hoster Tully]] of [[Riverrun]] considers Lord [[Jonos Bracken]] one of his most loyal bannermen. Catelyn announces that she will return Tyrion to Winterfell to await the King's justice. The Knight of House Bracken draws his sword and threatens Tyrion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion in the inn.png|thumb|Kurleket holds his sword on Tyrion Lannister at the Crossroads Inn.]]\nHe accompanies Catelyn east into the Vale of Arryn; her claims to be headed to Winterfell were a diversion.

The party are attacked by warriors from the hill tribes. Kurleket dies defending Catelyn.
