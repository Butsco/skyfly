It is a very large castle located at the center of [[the North]], from where the head of House Stark rules over his people.  A small Godswood is enclosed within the walls.  It is the capital of the North under [[King in the North|King]] [[Robb Stark]]. The castle is located alongside the Kingsroad as it makes its way from [[the Wall]] to the capital at [[King's Landing]], more than a thousand miles to the south. It is situated atop hot springs which keep the castle warm even in the worst winters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/winterfell/ HBO viewers guide, Season 1 map, Winterfell entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Winding tombs below the castle contain the remains of Stark kings and lords and record the history of the ancient family.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The castle has stood for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/winterfell/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Winterfell entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe castle is [[Sack of Winterfell|put to the torch]] by [[Ramsay Snow]] after [[Theon Greyjoy]] was betrayed by his own crew.  This burned out the wood portions of the castle, though the core stone structures remained fundamentally intact, as did the enclosed godswood.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\u00c2\u00a0After the [[Fall of Moat Cailin|fall]] of [[Moat Cailin]], the\u00c2\u00a0[[House Bolton|Bolton]] army is currently en route to Winterfell.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Winterfell is a huge castle complex spanning several acres, consisting of two massive walls with a ditch between them and a village located just outside. The complex consists of many buildings and keeps, some ancient and decrepit, some in good repair. According to legend, Winterfell was built by Bran the Builder eight thousand years ago.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "For the television series, a variety of locations were used to create Winterfell as it appears on screen. For the pilot episode, [[wikipedia:Doune Castle|Doune Castle]] in [[wikipedia:Scotland|Scotland]] was used for some exterior shots and the great feast held when King [[Robert Baratheon]] and his party arrive. [[wikipedia:Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] in [[wikipedia:County Down|County Down]], [[wikipedia:Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] was used for the scenes of sparring in Winterfell's castle yard and the arrival of Robert's party at Winterfell's gates. The rest of the castle, including the other interiors and the scenes involving [[Bran]] climbing the walls, were filmed as interiors at the [[Paint Hall]] studio facility in [[wikipedia:Belfast|Belfast]].\n\nFor the first season itself, Castle Ward was the principal filming location for the Winterfell scenes. Doune Castle was not revisited.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery columns=&quot;3&quot; spacing=&quot;small&quot; hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nWinterfell Exterior.jpg|The walls of Winterfell from up-close\nWinterfell Burning.jpg|Winterfell burning in &quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;\nWinterfell.jpg|Travelers departing from Winterfell.\nHouse Stark and retainers.jpg|The household at Winterfell: from left, [[Hodor]], [[Bran Stark]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]], [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], [[Luwin|Maester Luwin]], [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] and [[Rodrik Cassel]].\nWinterfell Godswood.jpg|The godswood at Winterfell, a place of peace and contemplation for worshippers of the [[Old Gods of the Forest]].\nSacked Winterfell.jpg|Winterfell as depicted in the title sequence after its sacking.\nWinterfell Title Sequence.jpg|Winterfell as depicted in the title sequence in the first two seasons.\nCastle_Ward_-_geograph.org.uk_-_104814.jpg|Castle Ward (Northern Ireland), where some Winterfell scenes were shot.\nDoune_Castle_-_front.jpg|Doune Castle (Scotland), used for filming some of the Winterfell scenes in the [[pilot episode]].\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Notable residents of the castle": "===Stark rule===\n* Lord {[[Rickard Stark]]}, the [[Lord of Winterfell]], [[Warden of the North]] and [[Lord Paramount of the North]].
