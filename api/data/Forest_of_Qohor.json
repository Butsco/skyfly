It borders the [[Free Cities]] region to the east and the [[Dothraki sea]] to the north-west. The [[Shivering Sea]] lies to the north. It contains the headlands of the [[Qhoyne]] river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/braavos/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Braavos entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Free City of [[Qohor]] is located on the forest's western edge. Despite its sheer size, the forest presents no significant obstacle to [[Dothraki]] ''[[khalasar]]s'', which can pass through the forest with impunity.\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Forest of Qohor is traversed by Drogo's ''khalasar'', taking a full month to pass through its eaves. The trees are huge, with barks as big as city gates and possessing leaves that give off a golden hue in the sunlight. Lemurs, spotted tigers and great elks are found within the forest.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\nThe ''khalasar'' of Khal [[Drogo]] passes through the Forest of Qohor on its way from [[Pentos]] to [[Vaes Dothrak]]. Based on comments by Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], it is possible that the immensely tall forest of reeds that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] orders the ''khalasar'' to halt in is part of the Forest of Qohor&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Snow]]&lt;/ref&gt;.\n\n"}, "title": "Forest of Qohor"}
