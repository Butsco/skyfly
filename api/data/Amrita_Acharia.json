She was confirmed in the role on 28 July 2010. She initially appeared as a guest star in the [[Season 1|first season]] and returned in this role for the [[Season 2|second season]].\n\nAcharia's character Irri was killed off in the middle of Season 2, even though the character Irri is alive as of the end of the fifth novel. Acharia apparently had to leave production on the TV series because she wasn't able to obtain Norwegian citizenship (even though most of her family has it), and thus wasn't about to extend her EU work visa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/05/curtain-call-amrita-acharia/ WinterIsCominet.net report] on Amrita Acharia's departure&lt;/ref&gt; Amrita recently did an AMA thread on reddit in which she stated that this was not the reason her character was killed off, instead saying that the writers know what they are doing and that she does still in fact have an EU work visa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uuiw2/amrita_acharia_portrayed_irri_on_game_of/c4yprh0]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 3822505}}\n*{{Template:Twitter\n|# = AmritaAcharia1}}\n* [http://www.spotlight.com/interactive/cv/021734239223 Amrita Acharia's Spotlight profile.]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Acharia, Amrita}}\n\n"}, "title": "Amrita Acharia"}
