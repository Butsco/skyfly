The lake lies outside of the territories controlled by Norvos, Qohor and Volantis, meaning that numerous river pirates operate on and near the lake. It is another border zone, somewhat like the [[Stepstones]] (which are also filled with pirates), claimed by many but truly controlled by none. Volantis's area of control only begins south of the Sorrows and ruins of [[Chroyane]].\n\n"}, "title": "Dagger Lake"}
