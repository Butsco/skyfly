Frustrated by the city's constant uprisings, the Valyrians pulled down the city's walls, burned the buildings to ashes and cinders and poisoned the surrounding lands with salt, sulphur and skulls to prevent it from rising again.\n\nThe city and the Ghiscari Empire were founded by Grazdan the Great, a mighty leader. Its symbol, and that of the Empire it led, was that of a harpy clutching a thunderbolt.\n\n", "Inspiration": "\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Old Ghis has many similiarities with Carthage, capital of the Carthiginian empire, the great rival of the Roman Republic. The two empires engaged in three bloody wars. At the end of the last, the Romans destroyed the city and according to legend sowed the soil with salt to prevent the city rising again.\n\n"}, "title": "Old Ghis"}
