Some of the material he shot for the pilot remains in the [[Winter is Coming (episode)|first episode]] of the series, most notably the scenes in the crypts under [[Winterfell]] involving [[Robert Baratheon]] and [[Eddard Stark]]. Much of the rest of the episode was reshot by [[Tim Van Patten]]. Rather than jointly credit the episode to both McCarthy and Van Patten, [[HBO]] gave McCarthy a 'consulting producer' credit on the first episode.\n\n", "Series credits": "==='''Director'''===\n* [[Pilot episode|Unaired pilot episode]]\n\n==='''Consulting producer'''===\n* ''[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]''\n\n"}, "title": "Thomas McCarthy"}
