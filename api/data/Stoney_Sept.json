The sept itself sits on a hill. Below it is a holdfast made of grey stone that seems undersized for the town that surrounds it. The heart of Stoney Sept is a market square with a fountain in the shape of a leaping trout. Stoney Sept isn't nearly big enough to be considered even a minor city, but it is a fairly large market town. [[Arya Stark]] is brought there after she encounters the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], and notes that it is the biggest town she's seen since she left King's Landing.\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nStoney Sept was the site of one of the most important battles of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. [[Robert Baratheon]] hid in the town with the aid of the [[smallfolk]]. When the royal army arrived to search the town from house to house the bells of the local [[sept]] were rang, giving the ensuing battle its name: the [[Battle of the Bells]]. The arrival of [[Eddard Stark]], [[Jon Arryn]] and [[Hoster Tully]] secured the rebel victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert's Rebellion (Complete Guide to Westeros)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Stoney Sept"}
