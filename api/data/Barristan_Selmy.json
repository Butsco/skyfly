He is played by guest star [[Ian McElhinney]] and debuts in &quot;[[Lord Snow]].&quot; Ser Barristan Selmy is a [[knight]] who is considered by many to be one of the best swordsmen in the whole of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and is known as '''Barristan the Bold'''. He served in the [[Kingsguard]] with honor and distinction for almost forty years, before being abruptly dismissed by King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].\n\nInsulted by his dismissal from the Kingsguard, Selmy makes his way across the [[Narrow Sea]] to [[Astapor]] and seeks out [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. After saving Daenerys from an [[Unidentified Warlock|assassination attempt]], he pledges fealty to her and becomes one of her trusted advisors.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Barristan Selmy is one of the most skilled and respected knights in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He started learning the art of combat as a small child and was taking part in tourneys while barely a teenager (he earned the epithet &quot;Barristan the Bold&quot; when he disguised himself as a knight and jousted with a Targaryen prince when he was only ten years old). He was made a member of the Kingsguard while very young and proved his valor in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], where he slew Maelys the Monstrous, the last of the [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre]] Pretenders, in combat on the [[Stepstones]]. He also rescued King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] from the rebellious Darklyns during the Defiance of [[Duskendale]].\n\nOne of Ser Barristan's most famous heroic deeds was the campaign against the notorious outlaw gang known as the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]], in which he, Arthur Dayne, Lord Sumner Crakehall, and [[Jaime Lannister]] participated. At that battle, Ser Barristan killed the Brotherhood's leader [[Simon Toyne]] and rescued Lady Jeyne Swann and her septa. Unlike mentioned in the TV series, Jaime was fifteen years old then; he served as a squire for Lord Sumner Crakehall, not for Ser Barristan; he did not kill any of the outlaws, but crossed swords with the Smiling Knight (who was killed by Arthur Dayne) and saved his master from another of the Brotherhood. As a reward for his valor, Jaime was knighted by Arthur Dayne that day.\n\nLike many, Barristan was disturbed by the increasing insanity of King Aerys, but continued to serve the Targaryens due to his strong belief in keeping his vows. Indeed, by the end Barristan (along with many others) wasn't really serving the Mad King so much as he was serving Crown Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], who it was generally thought would be a great king when it came time to succeed. Most were hoping to simply wait out the remainder of Aerys's kingship until he died and Rhaegar succeeded him, rather than deal with the moral dilemma of rebelling against their sworn king.\n\nDuring [[Robert's Rebellion]] Ser Barristan remained true to King Aerys and fought alongside his son Prince Rhaegar at the [[Battle of the Trident]]. Barristan took grievous wounds and was captured; [[Roose Bolton]]\u00c2\u00a0urged that he should be killed,\u00c2\u00a0but Robert was inspired by the great loyalty and bravery Barristan had displayed during the battle, so Robert not only spared his life, but sent his own personal [[maester]] to treat Barristan's injuries. By the time he had recovered, Rhaegar and King Aerys were both dead and Robert enthroned. Barristan was convinced to remain in the Kingsguard to provide continuity on the basis of his reputation for honor and steadfastness.\n\nFive of King Aerys's Kingsguard were killed during Robert's Rebellion, all except for Barristan and Jaime Lannister. Rarely if ever have so many vacancies occurred at once in the Kingsguard. Many of the replacements were the result of political appointments made to appease other Houses rather than being selected for either valor or skill at arms. As a result, Robert's Kingsguard was considered to be one of the worst in its history, with many regarding Barristan and Jaime as the only true remaining knights of the Kingsguard. While Ser Jaime Lannister was considered to certainly be one of the most formidable swordsmen in all of the Seven Kingdoms, his retention in the group after his murder of King Aerys was particularly controversial. As a result, many throughout the realm considered Ser Barristan to be the only true and honorable living member of the Kingsguard. It is also mentioned that Selmy never wanted Jaime in the Kingsguard; before Robert's Rebellion, Selmy thought Jaime too young and unready and afterwards\u00c2\u00a0he\u00c2\u00a0believed Jaime should be exiled to the [[Night's Watch]].\n\nIn the novels Selmy also sits on the King's [[small council]] and advises the King, particularly on military matters, and he takes Ned Stark's side that an assassination\u00c2\u00a0contract should not be taken out on the now pregnant [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. He does not appear at the council in the TV series. After being dismissed from the Kingsguard, a disgusted Barristan throws his sword at Joffrey's feet, telling him to melt it down and add it to his throne, and declares his contempt for Jaime Lannister and the rest of the Kingsguard, He predicts that Stannis will take the Iron Throne from the boy-king, and then storms off. Joffrey takes Barristan's last words as a treasonous threat and orders the Gold Cloaks to go after Barristan and apprehend him. They catch him at one of the gates, but Selmy kills two of his attackers and flees King's Landing. In the TV series, Barristan is allowed to leave quietly.\n\nSelmy sells his sword and armor, disguises himself as a beggar and hides in the capital instead of returning to his family's lands, not wanting to cause them trouble because of Joffrey's quarrel with him. He recounts at one point that he\u00c2\u00a0was present in disguise at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] when Ned Stark was executed and prayed for Ned's soul afterwards (despite Ned's\u00c2\u00a0attempt to depose Joffrey,\u00c2\u00a0Barristan continues to remember and defend Eddard as an honorable man). It was at that point\u00c2\u00a0Barristan realized how far he had fallen, having spent so many years\u00c2\u00a0defending the man who'd overthrown his rightful king and serving alongside treacherous scum like the Kingslayer and others just as bad;\u00c2\u00a0Barristan recognized that Robert had been a good man but a bad king,\u00c2\u00a0and decided he had to find the rightful Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne and make amends for his sins, or die in the attempt.\n\nFor some time afterwards, Ser Barristan's whereabouts are a mystery in Westeros. Renly asks Catelyn Stark if Barristan has joined Robb. He tells her that the rainbow cloak of his guard that he bestowed on Brienne was the one he had been saving for Barristan Selmy as he had expected him to show up to support him after his words to Joffrey. When Tyrion arrives in King's Landing, he berates Queen Cersei for dismissing Barristan, whom he says is now sure to join up with one of their enemies. As a revered figure in Westeros, Barristan pledging to the cause of one of the rival claimants to the Iron Throne would give them legitimacy in the eyes of the [[smallfolk]], which she simply had not considered (one of a growing string of follies in which Cersei doesn't think out the obvious long-term repercussions of her actions). This is of course exactly what happens, but everyone assumed that Barristan would seek out the &quot;rightful heir&quot; by supporting the claim of Stannis Baratheon or possibly his younger brother Renly, or else might join the Starks. None suspected that Barristan would leave Westeros in search of the surviving ''Targaryen'' heir, Daenerys.\n\nWhile on the run, Barristan grows his hair and beard (much longer than in the show) as a precaution. The disguise works so well that no one recognizes him despite being famous all over Westeros and outside of it, Not even Jorah Mormont realizes his true identity.\n\nIn the books, Ser Barristan foils the assassination attempt on Dany using a staff, rather than a dagger as in the series. Furthermore, he meets her on the docks of Qarth as she is about to leave for Astapor, not on the docks of Astapor when she arrives there. When he first meets Daenerys, he presents himself as an old man in service to [[Illyrio Mopatis]], acting under the alias of &quot;Arstan Whitebeard&quot;. He is accompanied by Strong Belwas, whose character has thus far not appeared in the show. His true identity is not revealed for some time and Jorah does not recognize him.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Meereen]], Barristan saves Daenerys from [[Mero]], using a staff to kill him. Jorah is astonished that a squire could kill Mero. Only then does he realize who &quot;Arstan&quot; really is, and Barristan reveals himself to Daenerys. He then reveals that Jorah was spying on her for Varys.\n\nThe TV series cut the &quot;Arstan Whitebeard&quot; subplot, simply having Barristan reveal his true identity as soon as he meets Daenerys and Jorah. It is possible that it was left out of the adaptation because while the true identity of &quot;Arstan&quot; was a surprise for book readers, TV viewers would visually recognize him. Moreover, the TV series moved around the chronology so that Daenerys only learns about Jorah's betrayal at the end of Season 4, meaning that Barristan would have had to spend two full seasons with Daenerys but without revealing Jorah's secret. The TV series ''did'' take care to alter events to make this change fit: Barristan is simply not present at the small council meeting in Season 1 during which Jorah's spying activities are being discussed. In Season 3's &quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;, the writers went so far as to have Jorah fear that Barristan knew of his spying from small council meetings. Barristan explains that Robert did not trust an old Targaryen loyalist to attend his council meetings, and Barristan was content to avoid them anyway because he disliked politics. Thus the official change was established that in the TV continuity Barristan simply never knew that Jorah was spying.\n\nDaenerys, disgusted, dismisses both men and gives them a suicide mission: to help her capture Meereen by infiltrating the city via its sewer system. Both men miraculously survive and help her take the city. They are called before her again. Barristan humbly begs forgiveness for his deception, and for abandoning her family after Robert took the throne. He explains that he kept his identity a secret to prevent the Lannisters discovering his whereabouts, and to observe Daenerys and get to know her better, to determine that she did not have the same [[Targaryen madness|streak of insanity]] as [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]]. He pledges to serve her in any role she sees fit for him, even a cook or a [[fool]]. She pardons Barristan and appoints him to her Queensguard, but banishes Jorah.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Barristan Selmy&quot; is pronounced &quot;BAIR-iss-tin SELL-mee&quot;, as opposed to &quot;BARR-iss-stan&quot;, etc.\n\n", "Quotes": "\n{{Quote|I am a knight!

Barristan recalls his first kill as being a Tyroshi soldier whose name he never knew. Barristan killed him with a lance to the heart. Barristan and Jaime also discuss their campaign against the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]], when Barristan slew [[Simon Toyne]] in single combat while Jaime scored his own first kill - an outlaw he decapitated - as a squire of fifteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;E3&quot; /&gt; Selmy attends the King at the tournament thrown in honor of Lord [[Eddard Stark]]'s appointment as [[Hand of the King]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Barristan and Eddard.jpg|thumb|Barristan Selmy talks with Lord Stark.]]\n\nBarristan stands vigil for Ser [[Hugh]] of [[Vale of Arryn|the Vale]] after his death in a [[tournament]] accident. Eddard quizzes him over Hugh's death and how the lots are drawn to determine which knight will face another in the contests. Eddard states that, in [[Rickard Stark|his father's]] opinion, Barristan was the finest knight in the Seven Kingdoms. Barristan acknowledges that the [[Mad King]]'s murder of Eddard's father was a grave crime and he is glad they did not cross swords at the [[Battle of the Trident]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBarristan later accompanies Robert, his squire [[Lancel Lannister]] and Lord [[Renly Baratheon]] on a hunt in the [[Kingswood]]. The king reflects on how much better things used to be, but Renly angrily accuses him of nostalgic self-delusion before stomping off. Barristan is bemused by the exchange, as well as Lancel's constant refilling of Robert's wineskin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robert tracks a boar and attempts to kill it singlehanded. He takes a grievous wound but finishes the boar off with his dirk. Barristan bitterly claims to have failed the king as Robert lies on his deathbed, but Eddard counsels him that no one could protect Robert from himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;You Win or You Die&quot;&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Barristan.png|thumb|Barristan reads the last words of King Robert.]]\nBarristan accompanies the wounded king's return trip to [[King's Landing]] and stands guard outside his chambers. After Robert's death, he stands guard in the throne room as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] commands his counsellors to swear fealty to him. Barristan is shocked when Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] destroys Robert's proclamation announcing that Eddard is to become the Protector of the Realm, but even more so when Eddard says that Joffrey has no claim to the [[Iron Throne]]. During the ensuing melee, Eddard orders that Barristan is not to be harmed, but the [[City Watch]] betrays and murders Eddard's men and takes Eddard prisoner instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;You Win or You Die&quot;/&gt;\n\nJoffrey later shocks the court by publicly dismissing Barristan from the Kingsguard - which is an irrevocable lifetime appointment - on the grounds of old age and the fact he failed to protect Robert. In reality, of course, Cersei is cleaning house by removing anyone from court who isn't a dedicated Lannister-loyalist. Barristan's shock turns to outrage when Cersei announces that his position as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard is to\u00c2\u00a0be given to\u00c2\u00a0Jaime Lannister. Barristan openly denounces Jaime as &quot;the man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!&quot;, causing Cersei\u00c2\u00a0to angrily rebuke him. Varys tries to defuse the situation by\u00c2\u00a0offering Selmy a keep to live in and servants to tend his needs out of respect for his years of service, but Ser Barristan bluntly refuses the offer, insulted at\u00c2\u00a0the council's attempt to fob him off with &quot;a hall to die in and men to bury me&quot;, and tears off his cloak, breastplate, and some other items saying he is a knight and will die a knight. [[Littlefinger]] crassly jokes that he will apparently be a &quot;naked knight&quot;, which causes the whole court to laugh at him.\n\n[[File:Ser Barristan challenging the court..jpg|thumb|left|Ser Barristan challenging the court.]]\nHowever, their mockery\u00c2\u00a0abruptly comes to an end when\u00c2\u00a0Selmy draws his sword in fury, silencing the entire court. Though the other five Kingsguard members block his path to the Iron Throne and Joffrey, Barristan sneers that even now he could kill the other five Kingsguard as easily as &quot;carving a cake&quot;. There is a tense pause in the throneroom, as despite his old age Barristan is such a legendary and skilled knight they know that he might indeed be able to fight his way through to harm Joffrey. However, Selmy notes the presence of [[Janos Slynt]] and the [[gold cloaks]] and ultimately realizes he is too badly outnumbered.\u00c2\u00a0He still mocks their fear of him\u00c2\u00a0by throwing\u00c2\u00a0his sword at Joffrey's feet, telling the &quot;boy&quot; to melt it down and add it to the others that make up the Iron Throne, before storming out in disgust. Ser Jaime was indeed named as the new Lord Commander in Barristan's place, though in absentia as he was captured by the Starks in battle before he could return to King's Landing. Jaime's own place in the Kingsguard was replaced by Joffrey's personal bodyguard [[Sandor Clegane]], an affront to the institution, as Sandor is not even a knight.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\n\nThe whereabouts of Ser Barristan are unknown.\n\nWhile imprisoned, Jaime Lannister tells Ser [[Alton Lannister]] about his time as Ser Barristan's squire, describing him as &quot;a painter who only used red&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Man Without Honor&quot;/&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\n\n[[File:Barristan meets daenerys.png|thumb|Barristan joins Daenerys.]]Ser Barristan tracks down [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to [[Astapor]] in [[Slaver's Bay]], where he saves her from an assassination attempt by a [[Unidentified Warlock|member]] of the [[Warlocks]] of [[Qarth]], preventing a [[Manticore]]\u00c2\u00a0from harming her. Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] identifies him to the young queen, and Selmy quickly bows to proclaim his loyalty to her, explaining that in serving her, he hopes to make amends for his failure to protect her family in [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Declaring that she is the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, he asks to serve in her Queensguard.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs Daenerys prepares to negotiate for the purchase of Astapor's [[Unsullied]], Barristan strongly argues against using slaves-soldiers as dishonorable. Jorah is in favor of using them, but Barristan retorts that when Daenerys' older brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] led his army in the [[Battle of the Trident]], men fought and died for Rhaegar because they believed in him, because they loved him - not because they were slave soldiers whose free will had been stripped away. Jorah responds that Rhaegar indeed fought honorably and nobly, but that in the end Rhaegar died. Daenerys was born months after [[Robert Baratheon]] killed Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, and only knew her cruel and half-mad brother [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]], so she asks Ser Barristan if he knew Rhaegar. As a member of the Kingsguard at the time, Barristan knew Rhaegar well: he fought beside him and bled beside him at the Trident. Barristan says that Rhaegar was the finest man he ever met, the last dragon. Daenerys grows quiet and says she wishes she'd known her older brother, but that Rhaegar was not the last dragon (she is).\n\n[[File:Daenerys orders barristan and jorah to not question her.png|thumb|left|Daenerys orders Jorah and Barristan to never question her again in public.]]\n\nLater, when Daenerys agrees to give the [[Good Masters]] her largest dragon in exchange for the Unsullied, Ser Barristan openly protests, begging her to win Westeros back with dragons, not slaves. Daenerys ignores him and completes the transaction.

Barristan admits that Robert was a good man and a good warrior, but a terrible king. Barristan explains that a man of honor must keep his vows no matter what, whether he's serving [[Robert Baratheon|a drunk]] or [[Aerys II Targaryen|a lunatic]]. Barristan also explains that Robert never trusted him to do anything more than protect him, hence Barristan was barred from Small Council meetings, though the Lord Commander is usually the Small Council's military attach\u0102\u0160.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Barristan brings captains of the second sons.png|thumb|left|Barristan brings the captains of the Second Sons to Daenerys.]]\n\nSer Barristan is present when Daenerys and Jorah gather reconnaissance\u00c2\u00a0on the [[Second Sons (mercenary company)|Second Sons]] and confirms that their presence will pose a problem.
