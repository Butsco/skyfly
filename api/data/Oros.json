The city is located at what used to be the meeting point of the Valyrian Peninsula and the Essosi mainland. The area immediately south of Oros was obliterated in the [[Doom of Valyria]] four centuries ago, creating the [[Smoking Sea]]. The ruins of [[Tyria]] lie across the sea to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/valyria/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Valyria entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Oros is connected by a Valyrian road to [[Mantarys]]. It was located close to the Fourteen Fires, the great volcanic mountain range stretching across the neck of the Valyrian Peninsula. Given its close proximity to the volcanoes, it was likely laid waste during the Doom.\n\n"}, "title": "Oros"}
