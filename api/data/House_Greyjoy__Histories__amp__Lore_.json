It is narrated by [[Alfie Allen]] and [[Gemma Whelan]] as Prince [[Theon Greyjoy]] and Princess [[Yara Greyjoy]], respectively.\n\n", "Synopsis": "[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] divulge the history of the [[ironborn]] and how [[House Greyjoy]] became the dominant family of the [[Iron Islands]].\n\n", "Summary": "Where [[the North]] has its honor and the South its chivalry, the [[Iron Islands]] has its strength. The [[ironborn]] are warriors feared throughout the [[Seven Kingdoms]], or so they used to be.\n\nUnlike their mainland cousins, the [[First Men]] of the Iron Islands never bowed to the [[Old Gods of the Forest]]. Theirs was the [[Drowned God]], who made the ironborn to reave and sack and write their names in salt, steel and song. But his enemy the [[Storm God]] could not wash away. The ironborn raised their kings from their own ranks and used beaten foes as thralls to work their mines and farm their land, or as saltwives if a woman was pretty enough. Such was the [[Old Way (ironborn)|old way]], and as they followed it they held sway wherever the waves were heard.\n\nWhen [[Aegon I Targaryen]] came demanding fealty, King [[Harren Hoare]] ruled as far East as the [[Trident]]. Other kings like the [[House Stark|Starks]] could kneel, but Harren was ironborn and the ironborn must be beaten. In [[Harrenhal]] he had the mightiest castle in [[Westeros]] and the army to defend it, but Aegon did not intend a siege. He mounted his dragon [[Balerion]] and roasted Harren and all of his sons in their tower, and the old way with them.\n\nDue to their defiance, Aegon pushed to Ironborn back to their islands and gave the [[Riverlands]] back to [[House Tully]], but he did allow the ironborn to choose who would lead them. [[House Greyjoy]] had always been one of the greatest houses of the Iron Islands. They trace their descent from the [[Age of Heroes]] and the legendary [[Grey King]], who took a mermaid to wife and made war upon the Storm God for 1000 years. Blessed by the Drowned God, the Grey King fought and slew [[Nagga]] the great Sea Dragon and took her fire for his own.\n\nThis history made [[Vickon Greyjoy]] the natural choice to lead the Ironborn after Aegon's Conquest. For 300 years House Greyjoy ruled the Ironborn, styling themselves [[Lord of the Iron Islands]], [[King of Salt and Rock]], [[Son of the Sea Wind]], [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]]. In truth, they were thralls. Their people still chanted &quot;What is Dead May Never Die&quot;, but the old way had died.\n\nAfter the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] followed their [[dragons]] into the grave,\u00c2\u00a0[[Balon Greyjoy]] rose against the new king [[Robert Baratheon]]. Balon seized the ancient crown and sent his [[Iron Fleet|fleet]] against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] at [[Lannisport]], [[Raid on Lannisport|burning]] all of their ships before any could lay anchor. Though Robert and [[Eddard Stark]] later [[Siege of Pyke|defeated him]], they understood the ironborn no better than Aegon. The Greyjoy sigil is the kraken, and what it grasps once it will never surrender. What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.\n\n"}, "title": "House Greyjoy (Histories &amp; Lore)"}
