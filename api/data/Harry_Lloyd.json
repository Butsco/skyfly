Otherwise he would just be sneering and screaming all the time. He doesn't see himself as the villain. He's the hero of this story! That's how you have to play it...His is a singular obsession that drives everything: he wants his family's throne back, his birthright. It's like a religion, something he's never questioned. So you can't wink. You have to take it extremely seriously.|'''Harry Lloyd''' on playing Viserys Targaryen&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\n'''Harry Lloyd''' (born 17 November 1983) is an English actor who has worked in television, film and on stage.
