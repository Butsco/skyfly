If that is the case, &quot;Shamyriana&quot; is the correct name; however, the city in\u00c2\u00a0''The Worlds of Ice and Fire\u00c2\u00a0''\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;is in a slightly different location.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Shamyriana}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, no city called &quot;Samyrian&quot; has appeared. A city called &quot;Shamyriana&quot; has been mentioned. Like [[Bayasabhad]], it is known for its warrior-women. Merchants from Shamyriana trade at [[Vaes Dothrak]]. It is unclear if Samyrian and Shamyriana are the same city or different locations.\n\n''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' map collection does feature a city called &quot;Samyriana&quot;, located east of the [[Dothraki sea]] in roughly the same location but on the edge of a vast desert rather than on the coast of the [[Jade Sea]] (the Jade Sea having been moved on those maps so it runs south of Essos rather than forming a large bay within it).\n\nRan, the founder of Westeros.org and co-author of ''The Worlds of Ice and Fire'' book with [[George R.R. Martin]], weighed in on the issue: while ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' is meant to be the new canonical geography, the name &quot;Samyriana&quot; appearing on its maps is itself a misprint, and the proper spelling is indeed &quot;Shamyriana&quot;. However, because the city was mentioned only once in the first novel, rather than live with a known misprint on the official maps, subsequent reprints of the first novel may just be revised to use the spelling &quot;Samyriana&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/63618-the-lands-of-ice-and-fire-a-new-map-book-out-in-oct-2012/page__st__180#entry3751336 Westeros.org forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, the name of the city is supposed to end in an &quot;a&quot;, and the HBO Season 2 map is in error.\n\n"}, "title": "Samyrian"}
