Its worship is largely restricted to [[Lhazar]] itself. The worship of the Great Shepherd includes the presence of &quot;godwives&quot; or priestesses, such as the ''[[maegi]]'' [[Mirri Maz Duur]].\n\nIn the religion of the Great Shepherd, all men are considered part of a single flock, thus healers devoted to this god will cure the injuries of any man, even conquering enemies.\n\n"}, "title": "Great Shepherd"}
