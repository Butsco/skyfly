{"attributes": {}, "sections": {" In the books ": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bravos are young swordsmen that prowl the city of Braavos during the night. They dress in brightly colored finery and actively seek out fights to prove their skills. Most will fight with little cause, such as a man's opinion on who is the city's most beautiful courtesan, and some with no cause at all. Anyone carrying a sword after dark in Braavos can be challenged to a duel. Simply placing a finger on your sword while facing a bravo is akin to challenging them.\n\n", "TOP": "Bravos012704iuqwklxjp9m7lsu6hrtp22vzlep84mq1786492015-03-22T19:45:34ZThe Dragon Demands5014364[[File:Syrio Forel.png|200px|right|thumb|Syrio Forel, a bravo.]]\n{{Quote|This is the Bravo's Dance, the Water Dance.
