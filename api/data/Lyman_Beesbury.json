Lord Lyman was Lord of Honeyholt and the [[Master of Coin]] during the reign of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys the Conciliator]] and also under Viserys I, as replacement of Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]]. He was eighty when Viserys I passed away. When the small council met to plot crowning Prince Aegon, Viserys's eldest son by [[Alicent Hightower|his second wife]], over Princess Rhaenyra, Viserys's designated heir, Lord Lyman soundly protested even though he was outnumbered. Ser Criston Cole silenced the discussion by slitting Lord Lyman's throat with his dagger. He was replaced as Master of Coin by Ser Tyland Lannister, the [[Master of Ships]].\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nLord Lyman was a member of the Small Council under [[Viserys I Targaryen]].
