In Season 1, it is obviously a major shift when Daenerys starts to wear Dothraki clothing, showing that she is willing to\u00c2\u00a0immerse herself in their culture in a way\u00c2\u00a0Viserys never will, and earns reciprocal respect from them as a result. However, as Season 1 progresses, Daenerys later switches to a different outfit - still in Dothraki fashion, but made of tanned crocodile hide. The Dothraki also wear animal skins, but use horse-leather. Daenerys put her own Targaryen-themed twist on this by still using leather made from an animal, but from a reptile to evoke her ties to the ancient dragons. In Season 2, Daenerys switches to a Qartheen gown that Xaro provides her, yet she switches into different variants in a subtle progression throughout the season. Initially, Daenerys was awed by Xaro's generosity and Qarth's elegance, but almost at the risk of losing herself: as she increasingly starts to doubt Xaro and become dissatisfied with Qarth in general (as it becomes more apparent that none of them will give her the army she needs), she starts incorporating more and more &quot;Dothraki-style&quot; features back into her outfit. Instead of the completely Qarth-style gown she wore in &quot;Garden of Bones&quot;, she starts adding more metal armored pieces or leather, similar to her earlier Dothraki costume.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn Season 3, by the time that Daenerys's ship arrives in Slaver's Bay she has shifted into a new outfit which she retains for most of the rest of the season (alternating with others such as her white gown). In the Season 3 Blu-ray, Clapton explained why Daenerys wears a bright blue dress instead of, say, the traditional Targaryen colors of red and black (which Viserys\u00c2\u00a0wore): blue was the color of royalty in Khal Drogo's khalasar. It was the color of the expensive dye which they adorned themselves with, moreso on special occasions such as Drogo's wedding. This is comparable to how purple was traditionally the color of imperial or royal authority for centuries in Europe, because purple was the most expensive color dye (it could only be made from a rare sea snail). Thus, while in Season 3 Daenerys no longer wears a Dothraki-style &quot;cut&quot; to her outfit, she switched to blue colors as a symbol of her authority as a khaleesi and in memory of Drogo.&lt;ref&gt;Season 3 Blu-Ray special features&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "TOP": "Daenerys Targaryen02157dv8pbcq7rpxmh1bpqq00w1ksuh4kr971800952015-03-28T21:09:49ZArticXiongmao15030876/* Season 4 */::''For her great-grandfather Maekar's paternal aunt, see &quot;[[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys of Sunspear]]&quot;.''\n{{Heraldry\n|image = Targaryen mini shield.png\n|link = House Targaryen\n}}\n{{Character\n| Title=Daenerys Targaryen\n| Image=Dany_Season_5_GOT_HBO.jpg\n| Season=[[Season 1|1]], [[Season 2|2]], [[Season 3|3]], [[Season 4|4]], [[Season 5|5]]\n| First=&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;\n| Last=\n| Appearances=33 episodes &lt;small&gt;[[#Appearances|(see below)]]&lt;/small&gt;\n| Aka=Daenerys Stormborn&lt;br&gt;Dany&lt;br&gt;The Unburnt&lt;br&gt;''Mhysa''&lt;br&gt;The Queen Across the Sea&lt;br&gt;The Silver Queen&lt;br&gt;\n| Titles=Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name&lt;br&gt;Queen of Meereen&lt;br&gt;[[King of the Andals and the First Men|Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men]] (claimant)&lt;br&gt;Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms (claimant)&lt;br&gt;[[Protector of the Realm]] (claimant)&lt;br&gt;''Khaleesi'' of the Great Grass Sea&lt;br&gt;Breaker of Chains&lt;br&gt;Mother of Dragons\n| Status=[[:Category:Status: Alive|Alive]]\n| Death=\n| Place=[[Dragonstone]]\n| Allegiance=[[House Targaryen]]\n| Family={[[Aerys II Targaryen]]} - father/uncle&lt;br&gt;{[[Rhaella Targaryen]]} - mother/aunt&lt;br&gt;{[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]} - brother&lt;br&gt;{[[Viserys Targaryen]]} - brother&lt;br&gt;{[[Elia Martell]]} - sister-in-law&lt;br&gt;{[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]]} - niece&lt;br&gt;{[[Aegon Targaryen (Son of Rhaegar)|Aegon Targaryen]]} - nephew&lt;br&gt;Maester [[Aemon|Aemon Targaryen]] - great-uncle&lt;br&gt;{[[Duncan Targaryen]]} - uncle&lt;br&gt;{[[Daeron Targaryen (son of Aegon V)|Daeron Targaryen]]} - uncle&lt;br&gt;{[[Drogo]]} - husband&lt;br&gt;{[[Rhaego]]} - son (stillborn)&lt;br&gt;\n| Actor=[[Emilia Clarke]]|Age = 20 in Season 5&lt;ref&gt;Daenerys was born a few months after Robert's Rebellion ended, 17 years before Season 1, making her about 16 in Season 1.&lt;/ref&gt;|Culture = [[Valyrian]]|ImageSize = 250px}}\n{{Quote|You have a good claim:  a title, a birthright.

She is played by starring cast member [[Emilia Clarke]], and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming|series premiere]].\n\nShe is the only surviving child of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], who was ousted from the [[Iron Throne]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Daenerys's mother was sent to safety on\u00c2\u00a0[[Dragonstone]] island just before the [[Sack of King's Landing]], and died giving birth to her during a great storm which wrecked the remaining Targaryen fleet at anchor, earning her the sobriquet '''Daenerys Stormborn'''. She lives in exile in [[Essos]]. Daenerys was sold into marriage to the [[Dothraki]] [[Khal]] [[Drogo]]; the two gradually fell in love, but she lost her husband and [[Rhaego|stillborn son]] to the manipulations of the vengeful maegi [[Mirri Maz Duur]]. Her marriage to Drogo and subsequent interaction with the Dothraki people gives her the confidence and strength to lead and the belief in herself as the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Following the death of her brother Viserys, Daenerys was left as the last Targaryen, and intends to claim the Iron Throne as her birthright. She formally styles herself as '''Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of Her Name'''.\n\nShe hatched three [[dragons]] by having her petrified dragon eggs placed on Drogo's funeral pyre, before she walked into the flames to claim them. Her dragons are the first seen in the world for hundreds of years, earning her the sobriquet '''Mother of Dragons'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ghost of Harrenhal&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring her campaign in Slaver's Bay, she is introduced as '''Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, ''Khaleesi'' of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Laws of Gods and Men&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; \u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;She has proven herself as a leader and a conqueror through her swift and (for the most part) merciful conquests of the Free Cities of [[Astapor]] and [[Yunkai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daenerys was born on the Targaryen island refuge of [[Dragonstone]] eight months after her father's death. Her mother died giving birth to her, and a great storm raged at the moment of her birth, destroying what was left of the Targaryen fleet anchored at Dragonstone, giving rise to the nickname &quot;Stormborn&quot;. The infant Daenerys and her brother Viserys were spirited into exile across the Narrow Sea by Ser Willem Darry, a loyal retainer of their family, before the castle garrison could hand them over to [[Robert Baratheon]].\n\nIn the books, Daenerys is the great-granddaughter of Aegon V, not his granddaughter. The show runners truncated the Targaryen family line in order to simplify her relationship to [[Aemon|Aemon Targaryen]]. They accomplished this by eliminating the reign of Jaehaerys II and making [[Aerys II Targaryen]] the son of [[Aegon V Targaryen]] instead of his grandson.\n\nThe books go into a little more detail about Daenerys's early life in the Free Cities. Initially, Daenerys lived with Ser Willem and Viserys in [[Braavos]], in a house with a big red door. Ser Willem was old and bedridden and yelled at the servants, but was very kind to Daenerys. After several years Ser Willem died and the servants drove the Targaryen children from the house, taking what money they had. Daenerys was old enough to remember living there, and has recurrent dreams about her last sight of the big red door, which came to symbolize the childhood she never had. The house in Braavos was the closest thing to a home Daenerys ever had, but even she never considered herself to be home there. Afterwards, the Targaryen children bounced around between different patrons, each enjoying having the Targaryen exiles as guests but abandoning them when the novelty wore off. Some briefly entertained the idea of helping them retake the Iron Throne, but as the years passed and Robert Baratheon's rule appeared more and more secure, the number of patrons dwindled and their lives grew meaner. Daenerys grew up living on the sufferance of others, frequently turned out on the street with little warning when their patrons lost interest in them. Viserys was reduced to pathetically begging for support throughout the Free Cities as they moved from patron to patron. In the process, they traveled from Braavos to Myr, then to Tyrosh, then to Qohor, then to Volantis, then to Lys, and ultimately to Pentos (each of the Free Cities except Norvos and Lorath). They never lived in one place for more than a few months, and their stay in Pentos with Illyrio was actually the longest time they had lived in one place since Braavos (for six months in the books, but stated to be over a year in the TV series).\n\nDaenerys does not appear to have a particular religious affiliation in the books. She grew up in the Free Cities, which have a more diverse religious composition than Westeros, so she has been exposed to several different religions but finds them to be confusing. Her final chapter in the third novel (''A Storm of Swords'' - Daenerys VI) begins with an inner narration from her POV in which she ponders aspects of different religions. The Targaryens converted to the [[Faith of the Seven]] when Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros three hundred years ago, and the ancient Valyrian religion is long extinct. Daenerys's brother Viserys apparently made some effort to explain the basic principles of the Faith of the Seven to her, considering that he hoped they would one day rule again over the Seven Kingdoms, where it is the dominant religion - but Daenerys thinks that the concept of a single god who is split into seven facets is confusing. She is also aware of the [[R'hllor|Lord of Light]] religion, given that it is the most popular religion in the Free Cities, but she thinks that its belief in a constant violent struggle between R'hllor and the Great Other to be too violent. Daenerys therefore has no particularly strong religious affiliations, but is fairly open-minded to the religions of new peoples she meets in Essos. While not outright &quot;converting&quot; to the [[Great Stallion]] religion of the Dothraki, after marrying Drogo out of love for her husband's god she finds herself praying to the great horse in the sky at times, even after Drogo's death. Still, Daenerys isn't particularly sure what her personal beliefs are.\n\nDaenerys is thirteen years old when the events of the novels begin. Dany is somewhat quiet and reticent, and fearful of her brother's famous rages, but also curious about life in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and eager to learn more of life there. She has a kind and generous spirit. This spirit slowly begins to harden after her brother's death and after surviving her first assassination attempt.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Daenerys Targaryen&quot; is pronounced &quot;Duh-NAIR-iss Tar-GAIR-ee-in&quot;.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria and I will take what is mine!

Viserys tells her that she has no choice. Viserys fondles her under the pretext that he is seeing how she has grown; she looks off into the distance. Daenerys enters a bath that her servant warns her is too hot, but it does not affect her; this may be related to her [[Targaryen]] heritage. At the wedding she accepts a variety of gifts. She receives three dragon eggs from Magister Illyrio, who tells her that they have been turned to stone by the passage of time.

While the [[Unsullied]], the elite warrior-[[eunuch]]s produced in Astapor, are regarded as some of the finest soldiers in the world, Daenerys knows that their being\u00c2\u00a0[[slave]]-soldiers would become problematic in Westeros, where slavery is outlawed.

Throughout the tour, Kraznys explains that the Unsullied were trained for battle from the age of five, and that only one in four recruits survived the training.\u00c2\u00a0He\u00c2\u00a0also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier, much to\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys's\u00c2\u00a0disgust. This soldier not only shows no sign of pain but even thanks his slave master for the opportunity to serve him.\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys also learns that the Unsullied are trained not to show mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training. While\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0is outraged by this, she still asks\u00c2\u00a0Kraznys how many Unsullied are available.

But, as she picks it up, the hooded stranger knocks it our of her hand. In response, Ser Jorah grabs the stranger and their struggle knocks\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys to the ground.

At\u00c2\u00a0the slaver's bay, she continues her negotiations with Kraznys over her planned purchase of the Unsullied. During the meeting, Daenerys announces that she would take all 8,000 Unsullied soldiers, including those in training. Kraznys initially dismisses her offer and instead offers to sell her one hundred soldiers. Daenerys then offers to sell him one of her dragons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walk of Punishment&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the end, Daenerys reaches an agreement with Kraznys to sell her biggest dragon, [[Drogon]], for all of the Unsullied soldiers. Jorah and Selmy object to this deal on the grounds that her dragons are key to winning the Iron Throne. However, Daenerys appears to brush away their concerns and accepts the transaction, and also takes\u00c2\u00a0Missandei as a token of faith. Upon leaving the meeting, she scolds\u00c2\u00a0Jorah and Selmy for criticizing her decision in public. Daenerys also asks\u00c2\u00a0Missandei for her name and whether she has any living family, but Missandei\u00c2\u00a0responds that she does not. Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0warns her that she was heading into war, she may be killed and fall sick and die. In response, Missandei recites the Valyrian\u00c2\u00a0aphorism: &quot;Valar\u00c2\u00a0morghulis&quot;, which translated into the Common Tongue as &quot;all men must die&quot;. Daenerys then realizes that Missandei actually knew [[High Valyrian]], and also\u00c2\u00a0adds that &quot;we are not men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walk of Punishment&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Drogon_takes_Flight_S3E4.jpg|thumb|200px|Drogon emerges.]]\nOn the\u00c2\u00a0day of the exchange, the slave masters and Kraznys, along with the 8000 Unsullied warriors, meet with Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0to complete the deal. Daenerys hands the chained\u00c2\u00a0Drogon\u00c2\u00a0to Kraznys, who is hostile towards his slave master. Kraznys then gives her the golden whip, the symbol of ownership over the Unsullied. After finalizing the transaction, Daenerys tests her new powers by ordering the Unsullied, in Valyrian, to march forward and then halt. This shocks everyone including Jorah and Barristan, who did not know that she spoke Valyrian.

She then orders the Unsullied to kill all the slave masters and free all the slaves in Astapor, but to hurt no innocent people.

Once it is done, she addresses all of her Unsullied warriors and tells them they are now free. She also gives them the option of leaving unharmed or fighting under her command as free men. At first, the Unsullied remain quiet, not knowing what to do with their new found freedom, however, one Unsullied soldier begins to beat his spear against the ground, signifying his allegiance to her. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit shortly thereafter. Now in command of an army of free men, Daenerys marches forward with her new army while her dragons fly overhead and roar triumphantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;And Now His Watch is Ended&quot; /&gt;\n\nDuring their journey to [[Yunkai]], the next great city of [[Slaver's Bay]], Daenerys ordered the Unsullied to elect a commander from their own ranks. The officers ultimately selected\u00c2\u00a0[[Grey Worm]], who like all Unsullied, was given the name of a vermin. When Daenerys instructed the Unsullied to go back to their own names or pick new ones they like, Grey Worm elected to keep his, as it was the name he had when Daenerys Stormborn set him free.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While Daenerys and Barristan were confident that they could conquer Yunkai since that city only bred bed slaves, Jorah expressed his concerns that the city's defenders would not fight them on the battlefield but would rather strengthen their position behind the walls and utilize guerilla tactics against her army. He also viewed the Yunkai campaign as a distraction from their main goal of taking Westeros. Dany was however adamant on freeing the slaves of Yunkai, who number in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;[[File:Season_3_Ep_4_Dany.png|thumb|200px|Daenerys after freeing [[Missandei]].]]\n\nShe ordered Grey Worm to send a messenger to the city and inform Yunkai's slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer [[Sack of Astapor|the same fate as]] [[Astapor]]. Daenerys held an audience with the Yunkish herald, [[Razdal mo Eraz]], who was one of the ruling &quot;[[Wise Masters]]&quot; of Yunkai. Razdal attempted to discourage Dany from attacking his city by claiming that numerous armies throughout history had tried and failed to conquer it. However, Daenerys was undaunted and commented that a hard-fought battle would give her Unsullied much needed practice. Razdal then attempted to bribe her by providing her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to Westeros. In exchange, Daenerys would have to leave Yunkai in peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; In response, Daenerys made a counter-offer: she would spare the lives of Razdal and the slave-masters of Yunkai if every slave (men, women and children) in the city were set free, and given as much food, clothing and property as they could carry in payment for their services. She threatened to show no mercy if Yunkai rejected her offer. Razdal was offended by Daenery's demands and threatened to use Yunkai's &quot;powerful friends&quot; to destroy her. Razdal's actions caused Dany's dragons to make threatening gestures. When Razadal protested that he had been promised safe conduct, Daenerys responded that her dragons had made no such promise and took offense to him threatening their mother. Razdal was also unable to reclaim the chests of gold he had brought with him. Following his departure, Dany ordered her knights to find out more about Yunkai's &quot;powerful friends&quot; before she committed herself to attacking the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Daenerysyunkai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Daenerys meets with [[Razdal mo Eraz]] in [[Yunkai]].]]\n\nThey eventually discover that these &quot;powerful friends&quot; are the [[Second Sons (mercenary company)|Second Sons]], a professional [[Mercenary|mercenary company]]. While there are only 2,000 of them, the Second Sons are armored and mounted, enough to cause trouble for the [[Unsullied]]. Daenerys tells Barristan to organize a meeting with the Second Sons' captains, saying that men who fight for gold &quot;can't afford to lose to a girl&quot;. Daenerys meets with the Captains [[Mero]], a [[Braavos]]i also known as the Titan's Bastard, and [[Prendahl na Ghezn]], a Ghiscari, and Prendahl's [[Daario Naharis]]. During the proceedings, Mero insults Daenerys by likening her to a whore and touches Missandrei inappropriately. Prendahl and Mero refuse Daenerys'\u00c2\u00a0offer of an alliance, pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the Iron Throne. In response, Daenerys replies that she had no army a fortnight ago and that she had no dragons a year ago. Daenerys gives them two days to make up their mind and sends them away with the barrel of wine which Mero had departed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Sons episode&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the Second Sons had departed, Daenerys instructed Barristan to kill Mero in the event that she had to fight with them. Barristan replied that he would be glad to do so. Later that night, Daenerys took a bath and was surprised to learn that Missandei spoke no fewer than nineteen languages. In response, Missandei commented that this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]]. The khaleesi bristled at the idea she spoke only ''reasonable ''Dothraki and switched to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an Unsullied entered and held a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removed his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He confessed that his captains had ordered him to kill Daenerys but he disagreed with them. Instead, he beheaded them and also produced their severed heads. Shortly later, Daario swore fealty to Daenerys. Thus, Daenerys gained a new ally in her fight against Yunkai.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Sons episode&quot; /&gt;\n\nFor their assault on Yunkai, the new captain Daario suggested attacking the city through its lightly defended back gate. Their plan was to infiltrate the city and open the main gates for the rest of the army to invade. While Ser Jorah was skeptical of the plan, Daenerys and Grey Worm were willing to trust Daario. During the war meeting, Daario attempted to flirt with her. For the battle, Ser Barristan remained behind to guard Dany, fulfilling his duty as a Queensguard. During that night, Jorah, Daario and the Grey Worm infiltrated the city and fought their way through the slave soldiers guarding the city. Within a few hours, Targaryen's forces had captured Yunkai.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; \n[[File:Dany_Mother_Mhysa.png|thumb|200px|People of Yunkai celebrate Daenerys as Mhysa]]\nThe following morning, Daenerys addressed the city's slaves with Missandei serving as her translator. During her speech, Daenerys told the slaves that it was their own choice to reach for their freedom. As a result, the liberated slaves revered Dany as their &quot;mhysa&quot;, which translated as &quot;mother&quot; from the [[Ghiscari Empire|Ghiscari]] language. Daenerys mingled with the former slaves who regarded her as a &quot;glimmer of hope&quot; in an increasingly dark world.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nDaenerys\u00c2\u00a0sits near the sea with her three dragons, each one about the size of a small horse.

Jorah remarks that even though she might be able to take King's Landing, she wouldn't be able to hold all the Seven Kingdoms. He also tells her that in Yunkai the Wise Masters re-established slavery and took control of the city, swearing to take revenge against Daenerys. In Astapor, the [[Astapori ruling council|ruling council]] she has left behind to rule has been overthrown by a butcher named [[Cleon]], who named himself &quot;His Imperial Majesty&quot;. Daenerys commands everyone except Ser Jorah to leave her and she questions her ability to rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros if she can't even pacify the three cities of Slaver's Bay. Thus she decides to stay in Meereen to gather more knowledge and experience, doing what queens do - rule.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDaenerys sets up time to hear petitions from her new subjects. Amongst the first is a goatherd whose flock were roasted by her dragons; Dany orders him paid three times their value. Next is [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]], who asks to be allowed to bury his father, one of the 163 Great Masters Daenerys ordered crucified. Dany is swayed by Hizdahr's arguments (aided by guilt upon realizing that the elder zo Loraq opposed the crucifixion of the slaves in the first place) and allows the burial. Missandei informs her that there are 200 more supplicants.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Laws of Gods and Men&quot; /&gt;\n\nSome weeks later, Daenerys is irritated to discover Daario in her private quarters. The mercenary tries to give her flowers, but the queen demands to know what he wants. Daario asks to be allowed to indulge in his only two talents: killing men and loving women. Dany counters that the Second Sons are assigned to patrol [[File:MV5BMTczNjExNTU3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM1NDM4MTE@._V1_SX1299_SY583_.jpg|thumb|200px|Daenerys and Daario at her chambers in Meereen.]]Meereen and keep the peace, and there are plenty of women in the city that Daario can pursue. Daario says that police work doesn't do the trick and that the only woman he wants isn't interested. Nonetheless, he confirms that he is sworn to her and that he will continue boring patrol work if that is what the queen wants, he only asks that she occasionally allow him to do what he is actually good at. In response, Daenerys orders him to take off his clothes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mockingbird&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Mockingbird]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe following morning, as Daario leaves, Jorah enters, observing that he is earlier than most, but later than others. Daenerys brushes off his disapproval and says that she is sending the Second Sons to retake Yunkai. To ensure that slavery is truly dead in that city, Daario is under orders to kill every Wise Master the Second Sons encounter. Jorah protests, warning her that good and evil exists on both sides of every conflict, and that he wouldn't be advising her today if [[Eddard Stark]] had done to him what she is about to do to the Wise Masters. After considering this, Daenerys instructs Jorah to tell Daario that she has changed her mind: his orders are now to accompany Hizdahr to Yunkai so that he can give the Wise Masters a choice: they can live in her new world, or die in their old one. As Jorah leaves, Dany says to tell Daario that it was Jorah who changed her mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mockingbird&quot; /&gt;\n\nDaenerys\u00c2\u00a0is in her chambers with Missandei.\u00c2\u00a0The two are talking about Grey Worm and how Missandei caught him gazing while she was bathing naked downstream.\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys asks whether Missandei thinks he was spying on her. She says no, and Daenerys mentions that\u00c2\u00a0the [[Dothraki]]\u00c2\u00a0have no taboos against nudity or public love-making. Of course, Missandei is not Dothraki, but she says it doesn't matter, as Grey Worm isn't interested in her - none of the Unsullied desire women. Missandei says he\u00c2\u00a0''was''\u00c2\u00a0interested, surprisingly to both of them. Daenerys inquires whether, when a slave is castrated, the masters take &quot;all of it&quot; - both the &quot;pillar&quot; and the &quot;stones.&quot; Missandei says she doesn't know, to which Daenerys asks if she's ever wondered. Thoughtful, Missandei confirms that she has.\u00c2\u00a0Later on, Ser Barristan Selmy find out that Jorah Mormont was [[File:DanyJorahExile.png|thumb|left|200px|Daenerys banishes Jorah from her service.]]spying on Daenerys. Jorah enters the throne rome in Meeren, in\u00c2\u00a0an audience before her, a seething Daenerys demands an explanation, and Jorah says it is a plot by Tywin Lannister\u00c2\u00a0to divide them. Dany counters that the pardon was signed the year they met. Asking him whether he claims the pardon was forged, Jorah admits that it was not. He soon confesses to giving\u00c2\u00a0[[Varys]]\u00c2\u00a0information on Daenerys' activities in\u00c2\u00a0[[Essos]]. Daenerys angrily says that his telling them of her pregnancy by Khal Drogo\u00c2\u00a0led to her\u00c2\u00a0[[You Win or You Die|near-poisoning at the hands of a wine merchant]]. Jorah then protests that his actions stopped her from being poisoned, but Daenerys retorts this was only because he knew it might be coming. Jorah begs for her forgiveness, but Dany rebuffs him, saying he betrayed her, selling her secrets to the man she holds responsible for the death of her family. She spares his life, however, and gives him a day to leave Meereen. She warns that if he is seen in the city after that, his head will be thrown into\u00c2\u00a0[[Slaver's Bay]]. Jorah is last seen leaving Meereen on a horse.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn Meereen, Queen Daenerys Targaryen\u00c2\u00a0sits in her throne room\u00c2\u00a0where she is receiving the day's supplicants. An old man named\u00c2\u00a0[[Fennesz]]\u00c2\u00a0approaches the throne.\u00c2\u00a0Fennesz explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor, but a well-educated teacher and servant to\u00c2\u00a0Master\u00c2\u00a0[[Mighdal]], who employed him as a teacher for his own children. He tells Daenarys that Master Mighdal's\u00c2\u00a0seven year old daughter\u00c2\u00a0[[Calla]]\u00c2\u00a0admires Daenerys, having learned of the\u00c2\u00a0[[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]]\u00c2\u00a0through Fennesz's teachings. As a servant of Master\u00c2\u00a0Mighdal,\u00c2\u00a0Fennesz\u00c2\u00a0was well-treated and even well-respected in the household, but when\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people. Fennesz originally stayed in Master Mighdal's house after she took the city. Mighdal's children begged him to stay, but Mighdhal and Fennesz agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals, forcing Fennesz to become homeless. Daenerys insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them. Fennez says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe: the young prey on the old, harassing\u00c2\u00a0and robbing them. Daenerys insists that her Unsullied will restore order, but Fennesz points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety, he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew. Therefore, he has come to Daenerys to beg her permission to sell himself back to Mighdal. She is shocked that he would\u00c2\u00a0''want''\u00c2\u00a0to be a owned as a slave again, as a man might own a goat or a chair. He implores her that the young who can adapt rejoice in her new world, but for those too old to change, there is only fear and squalor. Nor, he says, is he alone: there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests. Daenerys is crestfallen, and says she did not liberate the slaves of Meereen only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy, but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices. Therefore she allowed Fennesz to enter into a labor contract with Mighdal, but lasting no more than one year. He earnestly thanks her, and leaves.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n[[File:6f038a22773525ec3a2a270f79f892c3.jpg|thumb|200px|Dany in tears locks Rhaegal and Viserion in catacombs.]]\n\nThe next supplicant then enters, a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms. The shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to\u00c2\u00a0speak in the common tongue and requires Missandei\u00c2\u00a0to translate. Distraught, he tells\u00c2\u00a0Daenarys that the &quot;winged shadow&quot; came, placing the bundle on the ground and\u00c2\u00a0opening it to reveal charred bones - of a\u00c2\u00a0''human child''. Daenerys's largest dragon, the black one named\u00c2\u00a0[[Drogon]], has roasted the man's three year old daughter\u00c2\u00a0[[Zalla]]\u00c2\u00a0until this is all that was left of her. \u00c2\u00a0\n\nHorrified, Daenerys meets with Missandei\u00c2\u00a0and Grey Worm\u00c2\u00a0in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of Meereen.\u00c2\u00a0Grey Worm reports that Drogon was last seen flying over the black cliffs three days ago, but he can no longer be found. Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons,\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city. Later, she leads her remaining two dragons,\u00c2\u00a0[[Rhaegal]]\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0[[Viserion]], into the catacombs, where they are distracted by sheep carcasses. As they are feeding, Daenerys personally locks huge iron collars around their necks, which are secured by heavy chains. She weeps as she does so, as it is symbolically reducing her remaining &quot;children&quot; to chained-up slaves themselves.\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Children]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Personality": "Daenerys is polite and well-spoken, but filled with quiet determination. She used to be cowed by her brother's ambitions and his occasional cruel rages, but her time amongst the Dothraki has taught her pride, confidence and skills of command. She is still somewhat naive of the world due to being young and living her life as an exile (with only her petulant brother to rely on for knowledge), but she is intelligent and quick to understand now that she is free to pursue her own path.\n\nDaenerys spent her entire life living on the sufferance of others, bouncing back and forth between one benefactor or the next (like Illyrio Mopatis) with her brother, until whatever dreams they had of supporting the exiles' claim wore off and they'd have to move on to another patron. As a result, Daenerys has never known a true home. Constantly living under her brother's domination has given Daenerys a great empathy with the downtrodden of the world. She is deeply sympathetic to those she perceives as oppressed, while at the same time, her pent up frustration from years of being mentally and physically dominated by her petty would-be-king of a brother make Daenerys capable of being utterly ruthless against those she perceives as oppressing others. This has produced a large amount of black-white thinking in Daenerys's mind, and she can be idealistic to a fault. For example, on seeing the plight of the slaves in [[Slaver's Bay]], Daenerys becomes determined that she must free all of the slaves in the region - with little thought devoted to the practical after-effects which will result from this. A particular example is when the Greet Masters of Meereen crucified 163 children as she approached the city, in an attempt to intimidate her. After she took the city, instead of pardoning the slave-masters, she had 163 of them crucified in retribution, unconcerned about any negative political fallout which would result.\n\nUnlike many in her House, Daaenerys has thus far not exhibited the &quot;[[Targaryen madness]]&quot; that plagued her father (and to a lesser extent, Viserys). She can be ruthless to her perceived enemies, but while Viserys was cruel and demanding to his servants and even his benefactors, Daenerys reciprocates the loyalty of those who follow her with gratitude and compassion. On the other hand, insanity was often a late-onset condition in the Targaryens, and it remains to be seen how Daenerys's mentality develops as she matures.\n\n"}, "title": "Daenerys Targaryen"}
