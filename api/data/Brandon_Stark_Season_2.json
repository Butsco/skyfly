{"attributes": {}, "sections": {"The Ghost of Harrenhal": "In the great hall of Winterfell Prince [[Bran Stark]] holds court for his people. He remains the acting Lord of Winterfell and wears a gorget embossed with the direwolf of House Stark about his neck while the House Tully pin fastens his doublet. His brother [[Rickon Stark]] sits beside him, shelling nuts loudly with a rock. A shepherd reports being unable to tend to his flock with his three sons fighting in the south. He reassures Bran of the loyalty of his sons but says that there are growing numbers of wolves in the north and that he cannot protect his sheep from them alone. Bran offers to assign two orphans from Winterfell\u00e2&euro;&trade;s outlying Winterstown to aid him if he will give them room and board. The shepherd gratefully accepts, saying that his wife always wanted more children. When the shepherd leaves Bran tells Rickon to stop. Having seen everyone Bran tells [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] that he is going to go for a ride before dark and calls for Hodor.&lt;ref name=&quot;E15&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSer [[Rodrik Cassel]] enters the Great Hall calling for Bran. He reports that [[Torrhen\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Square]] is under siege. Luwin is shocked, remarking that Torrhen\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Square is just 14 leagues away and wonders how the Lannisters have reached so far north. [[Osha]] listens intently as she lights candles at the back of the room. Ser Rodrik speculates that it could be a raiding party led by [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] or a group of sellswords. Bran says that they must help their bannermen. Rodrik nods agreement and says that even with most of their forces fighting for Robb he can gather 200 decent men. Luwin wonders if Rodrik needs to take so many and Bran cautions that they must protect their bannermen if they expect their bannermen to protect them. Rodrik smiles at the boy\u00e2&euro;&trade;s wisdom and Bran orders him to leave as soon as he has his men. Rodrik confidently says that it will not take long because southerners do not do well in their territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;E15&quot;/&gt;\n\nHodor carries Bran across to the stables. Osha walks with them and Bran questions her about the significance of his dreams. She tells him to ask Luwin and he says that he already has to no avail. Luwin has never heard of a [[three-eyed raven]]. Osha says that must make the dream meaningless and Bran accuses her of lying. She warns him not to call her a liar despite his status. Bran asserts that she knows the meaning and she says that she did not say otherwise. Hodor and Osha help Bran into the saddle. Bran says that she did not give him an honest answer and she quibbles that it is not the same as being a liar. Bran says that it is not far off. Osha establishes that his dreams have featured the three eyed raven. She reminds Bran that he told her that he had no dreams when they visited the [[Godswood]] and says that he is the liar. He can only smile. She presses him about his recent dreams. He reports dreaming that the sea flooded Winterfell and drowned his people including Ser Rodrik. Osha reassures him that the sea is hundreds of miles away and hurries to take her basket of potatoes to the kitchens. Bran asks her what they say about the three eyed raven north of the Wall. She refuses to answer, saying only that they say all kinds of crazy things beyond the Wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;E15&quot;/&gt;\n\n", "The Old Gods and the New": "Bran is awakened by [[Theon Greyjoy]] bursting into his room. [[Dagmer Cleftjaw]] follows Theon into the room. Theon tells him that he has taken Winterfell. Bran is confused and groggy from sleep. Theon explains that he infiltrated the castle using grappling claws to scale the walls. Bran wonders why Theon has attacked them and Theon asserts his intention to seize the castle. Bran reminds Theon that he left to fight for [[Robb Stark|Robb]]. Theon tells Bran that Robb sent him back to Pyke and that he is now fighting for his father [[Balon Greyjoy]] instead of Robb. Theon asks where [[Hodor]] is, Bran says that he does not know and Theon sends Dagmer to find him, calling Hodor a halfwit.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTheon tells Bran that his people are being assembled in the courtyard. Bran asks why and Theon says that they will go down and tell them that Bran has yielded Winterfell. Bran says that he will never yield. Theon argues with him and then sits on the edge of his bed to explain that Bran must yield to protect his people. He says that a good lord would yield to save lives and Bran hesitates. Theon tells Bran to think carefully about his choice of words and gets up to leave. Bran stops him by asking if he hated the Starks the whole time that he lived with them. Theon has no answer and walks out.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\nTheon orchestrates Bran\u00e2&euro;&trade;s public surrender of the castle in front of the people of Winterfell. Among the crowd in the courtyard are Luwin, Hodor, [[Osha]], [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], [[Farlen]] the kennel master and his daughter [[Palla]]. Dagmer and Theon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s men maintain order among their prisoners. Bran says that he has yielded Winterfell and Theon instructs him to speak louder and refer to him as a prince. Bran repeats it as instructed and Theon takes over. He says that the people all know him and Farlen interrupts to insult Theon. Bran warns Farlen to keep silent. Theon tells Farlen to listen to Bran because the young lord has more sense than the kennel master. Bran tells his people to do as Theon commands. Theon tells the assembly that his father has declared himself [[King of the Iron Islands]] by donning the ancient crown of salt and rock. He says that Balon also claims [[the North]] by right of conquest and that they are now King Balon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s subjects. Farlen objects, asserting his loyalty to [[House Stark]] and begins to criticize Theon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s strategy. He is clubbed on the back of the head by one of Theon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s men and falls to the ground. Palla helps Farlen up as Theon tells the smallfolk that he will treat them well if they serve him as loyally as they did [[Eddard Stark]]. He warns that he will make any traitors regret betraying him.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\nTheon instructs Luwin to send ravens to Balon at Pyke and to his sister [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] at [[Deepwood Motte]] to inform them of his victory. He tells Luwin to order an additional 500 men from Yara. Luwin hesitates and Theon reminds him of his vows as a Maester of the Citadel to serve the [[Lord of Winterfell]]. Theon claims the title for himself and repeats his orders. Luwin accepts his orders and goes to send the messages.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\nOsha steps forward and calls Theon my lord. He arrogantly notes that she has learned how to address her betters and asks what she wants. bends the knee to Theon. She says that she was brought to Winterfell as a captive and reminds Theon that he was present the day she was taken. He claims to be the one who captured her. She bends the knee and offers to serve Theon. Theon asks how she will serve him and insults her by saying that he needs fighters not kitchen sluts. She says that Robb put her in the kitchens and that she will fight for Theon if he puts a spear in her hands. Theon suspects her of treachery and refuses. He orders her to get up and pushes her aside. She stands by Bran and he asks her why she is betraying them. She says that his dream has come true; the ocean has reached Winterfell and she does not intend to drown.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\nTheon continues to address the people but is interrupted by the arrival of [[Lorren]] and three men with a captive, Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]. Lorren says that they took him on his return from [[Torrhen\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Square]] and that he killed two of their men before he was subdued. Luwin returns to the courtyard as Lorren gives his explanation. Theon tells Ser Rodrik that it grieves him that they meet as foes. Rodrik counters by saying that it grieves him that Theon has less honor than a whore. Rodrik reminds Theon that he was raised at Winterfell and says that the people are his people. Theon denies the claim and Rodrik tells him that Robb considered him a brother. Theon says that his brothers are dead and died fighting the Starks. Rodrik retorts that they died in a war that Balon started. Rodrik says that [[Eddard Stark|Lord Stark]] raised Theon among his own sons and Theon angrily asserts that he was never treated as one of them and was a hostage. Theon tells Rodrik that Eddard is dead and that the Seven Kingdoms are at war. Theon again asserts that Winterfell is his. Rodrik says that he should have put a sword in Theon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s belly instead of his hand. Theon says that Rodrik has served faithfully and then begins a threat. Rodrik spits in his face. Theon orders Rodrik imprisoned but Dagmer counsels that he must die for his actions. Dagmer says that the men will not respect Theon while Rodrik lives. Theon hesitates and then announces the death sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\nBran reminds Theon that he said that no harm would come to the people if he yielded. Theon counters that Rodrik could not keep his mouth shut. Luwin approaches Theon and advises him not to make a hasty decision. Theon says that Rodrik chose to disrespect him in front of his men. Luwin counsels that Rodrik is worth more alive than dead and says that the Starks will ransom him. Luwin urges Theon to consider his actions. Theon hesitates and then looks at Dagmer who shakes his head. Theon warns the master to address him as Prince Theon or be next. Dagmer motions to Lorren, who drags Rodrik to the executioners block as Dagmer draws his sword. Bran, Rickon and the people cry out to Theon to have mercy. Rodrik stares defiantly at Theon and says that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword before calling him a coward. Theon pushes Dagmer aside and draws his own weapon. Bran calls out for Theon to stop and Theon retorts that Bran no longer gives commands. Bran begs Theon to stop and Rodrik tells Bran to hush, saying that he is going to see Bran\u00e2&euro;&trade;s father. Theon asks Rodrik if he has any last words and Rodrik says \u00e2&euro;&oelig;Gods help you Theon Greyjoy, now you are truly lost.\u00e2&euro;? Theon swings the sword down on Rodrik\u00e2&euro;&trade;s neck but his first blow does not kill him. Theon swings a further three times to the horror of the onlookers. He has to kick Rodrik\u00e2&euro;&trade;s head to finally sever it from his body. Theon looks around at his captives, realizing what he has done.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\nOsha seduces Theon to gain freedom of the castle. She then frees Bran, Rickon, Hodor and their direwolves Summer and [[Shaggydog]]. Osha is halted by [[Drennan]] in the [[Godswood]]. He asks where she is going and she claims that Theon has sent her to make the rounds of his men. She kisses him passionately and then slits his throat. She whistles twice and her charges emerge from the darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;/&gt;\n\n", "The Prince of Winterfell": "[[File:Bran_and_Rickon_Alive.jpg|thumb|The boys are alive]]\nMaester [[Luwin]] follows Osha into the crypts below Winterfell. She lights a candle while explaining that they evaded capture by doubling back from the farm. Bran sits round the corner from them, awake and listening to everything. She says that they used a stream to mask their scent from Theon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s hounds. She tells Luwin that she is hoping that the catacombs will be the last place that Theon thinks to search for them. Luwin says that she has been right so far. Osha asks about the charred bodies hanging at the gates. Luwin relates his suspicion that they were the farmers boys. Osha is horrified that Theon killed and burned innocent children for his ruse. Luwin warns her not to say anything to the Stark boys because Bran would blame himself. She promises to say nothing, agreeing that the Starks have suffered enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;E18&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "TOP": "Brandon Stark Season 20813634l7y864a968761b9vt56as88dr7d6v1167222014-03-06T02:42:54ZGreater good3347453All of this information is on the character's page{{Template:Delete}}In '''[[Season 2]] [[Brandon Stark]]''' remains a major character. Bran continues to experience strange dreams as he is tutored in ruling [[Winterfell]] by [[Maester]] [[Luwin]].\n\n", "A Man Without Honor": "[[Summer]] and [[Shaggydog]] roam ahead of the escapees along the banks of a stream. [[Osha]] regrets not bringing more food with them and Bran asserts that it was too risky to approach the kitchens. Osha argues that the people of Winterfell love the Starks and would have done anything for them. Bran responds that he was not willing to endanger the lives of his people by exposing them to Theon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s wrath. Osha says that Rickon cannot survive on walnuts alone and Rickon says that he is fine. Hodor cracks a walnut for him in the palms of his hands. Osha frets that they have been walking for hours and says that even Hodor will tire. Hodor responds by repeating his name and Osha affectionately calls him a sweet giant.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot;&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThey crest a hill and Bran asks them to wait, recognizing a distant farm. He says that it belongs to the [[Winterfell shepherd|shepherd]] who he recently assigned two orphan boys to. Rickon remembers the boys as Jack and Billy and adds that they will help them. Bran is again dubious about risking the safety of those that would help them. Rickon tells Osha that Billy is an excellent tree climber and she says that Rickon has not seen her climbing. Osha warns that Theon will be tracking them with hounds and that they cannot outrun them forever. Theon tracks them to the farm but then loses their scent. He returns to Winterfell with two charred bodies, claiming they are Bran and Rickon.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot;/&gt;\n\n", "The North Remembers": "At [[Winterfell]], Bran holds court with his vassals. [[Northern Lord|A lord]] begs for assistance preparing his holdfast for the coming winter. The lord recalls the skill of the builders who worked on [[Torrhen's Square]] and complains at length about the poor condition of his own home. [[Maester]] [[Luwin]] reminds the man that the maintenance of his home is his own responsibility. The lord complains that his young men are fighting [[Robb Stark]]'s war. Bran is offended by the man's failure to refer to Robb as his King and his inference that Robb wanted the war. Bran questions the Lord's fealty. Luwin interjects that they will lend the man four masons for a week, concluding the discourse. Bran stares at his counsellor and Luwin jokes that they didn't want the Lord there all day. Bran says that he did not like the way he spoke about Robb and Luwin sympathises before reminding Bran of his responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. He then greets the next in a long line of minor lords, Lord [[Portan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;E11&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBran dreams that he is [[Summer]], seeing the world through the [[direwolf]]\u00e2&euro;&trade;s eyes as he stalks through the [[Godswood]] and looks up at the [[Red Comet]]. He goes to the pool next to the Heart Tree and looks down at his reflection. The next day Bran has [[Hodor]] carry him out to the Godswood; Osha accompanies them and finds a plant that can be used to make a pain relieving tea. She asks Bran if he has had more strange dreams and he claims that he does not dream at all. He changes the subject to the comet, saying that he has heard men say it is an omen favouring Robb in the War. Osha says that she has heard people say the comet is Lannister red and favours their enemies and that she heard a stable boy say the comet was blood red and marked the death of [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]]. Hodor kneels by the pool and Osha helps Bran to the ground by its edge, affectionately stroking his hair. She tells him that stars do not fall for men and that a red comet signifies dragons. Bran stares at his reflection in the water and asserts that dragons are extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;E11&quot;/&gt;\n\n", "What is Dead May Never Die": "Bran experiences another strange dream. He sees the castle through Summer's eyes. Maester Luwin sends Hodor to rouse Bran. Summer follows Hodor to Bran's chamber and sits on his bed. Bran sees himself through the wolf's eyes as he awakens.&lt;ref name=&quot;E13&quot;&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring his lessons Bran tells Luwin about his wolf dreams. He relates them to stories of people that can live inside animals that he once heard from [[Old Nan]]. Luwin tries to reassure Bran that they are only dreams. Bran insists that his dreams are different, reminding Luwin that he and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] shared the same dream of their father's death. Luwin shows Bran the Valyrian steel link on his master's chain. He explains that it represents the study of the higher mysteries. Luwin says that despite his studies he never found true magic. He helps Bran to bed and tells him that &quot;the [[dragons]] are gone, the [[Giants]] are dead, and the [[Children of the Forest]] forgotten.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E13&quot;/&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Brandon Stark Season 2"}
