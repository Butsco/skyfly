It is the seat of [[House Arryn]], one of the oldest noble houses of [[Westeros]]. Their sigil is a soaring white falcon over a crescent moon upon a field of blue, and their words are &quot;As High As Honor&quot;.\n\nThe Arryns descend from the [[Andal]] invaders who sailed across the [[Narrow Sea]] and came ashore at [[the Fingers]]. According to legend, Ser [[Artys Arryn]], known as &quot;the Winged Knight&quot;, flew atop a giant falcon and landed atop the highest mountain, where he defeated the [[Griffin King]], winning the first victory of the Andals over the [[First Men]]. Ser Artys was declared King of the Mountain and the Vale, and the region renamed &quot;the Vale of Arryn&quot;.\n\nThousands of years later, [[Aegon the Conqueror]] arrived in [[Westeros]]. The Arryns bent the knee to the [[Targaryen]] warlord and were allowed to maintain their hold over the region as [[Lord Paramount of the Vale|Lords Paramount of the Vale]] and [[Warden of the East|Wardens of the East]]. The Arryns remained loyal to the Targaryen dynasty until Lord [[Jon Arryn]] joined Houses [[Baratheon]] and [[Stark]] in [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] against the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King Aerys]]. After the rebellion's victory, the new king, [[Robert Baratheon]], named Jon [[Hand of the King]], a title he held until his mysterious death.\n\n"}, "title": "House Arryn (Complete Guide to Westeros)"}
