She was the mother of [[Elenei]], who had been fathered by the [[God of the Sea]].\n\nWhen Elenei fell in love with Durran and gave her maidenhead to him, becoming a mortal afterward, her parents, enraged, sent forth a massive storm that destroyed Durran's bayside keep as a &quot;wedding gift&quot;. Durran declared war on Elenei's parents and rebuilt his keep, which was again destroyed. Four more castles were raised, each stronger than the last, and all of them were destroyed. Durran's seventh castle, [[Storm's End]] withstood the rage of the gods.\n\n"}, "title": "Goddess of the Wind"}
