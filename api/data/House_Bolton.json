Their original lands are in the northeast of the formerly-owned Stark territories. Their stronghold is a castle called the Dreadfort and the head of the house is the [[Lord of the Dreadfort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/roose-bolton/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark, Roose Bolton entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHouse Bolton is infamous for its centuries-old practice of [[flaying]] their enemies alive, to the point that they use a flayed man as their House sigil. The Boltons supposedly gave up this practice after [[bending the knee]] to House Stark,&lt;ref&gt;[[House Bolton (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and centuries later Lord [[Eddard Stark]] outlawed flaying in [[the North]] altogether, but the Boltons continue the practice.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHouse Bolton's [[Heraldry|heraldry]] consists of a red flayed man upside-down on an x-shaped white cross over a field of black. Their official motto is '''&quot;Our Blades Are Sharp&quot;''', though a common saying of members of the House is '''&quot;A naked man has few secrets; a flayed man, none&quot;'''.\n\n", "In the books": "[[File:FlayedSkinsDreadfortDungeon.jpg|thumb|House Bolton are said to have worn the skins of their enemies as cloaks after flaying them.]]In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Bolton is noted as one of the most powerful families of the North. They are noted for flaying their enemies alive and even wearing their skins as cloaks. They have even captured and flayed Starks in the distant past. House Bolton were unruly vassals of the Starks until approximately a thousand years ago, when they finally bent the knee. Three hundred years later they rebelled but were defeated. The armies of House Stark besieged the Dreadfort for two years before finally forcing the Boltons to surrender and submit.\n\nThe Boltons are considered a sinister and ill-omened house, but Lord Roose Bolton is noted as a capable battle commander. Roose Bolton fought alongside [[Eddard Stark]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. After the [[Battle of the Trident]], Roose suggested executing the defeated [[Barristan Selmy]], but Eddard and [[Robert Baratheon]] refused.\n\nBesides Lord Roose, the members of the family in the books are:\n\n* Bethany Ryswell, Roose Bolton's late wife.\n** {Domeric Bolton}, their only son and heir.\n** Ramsay Snow, his bastard son.\n\nDomeric Bolton died shortly before the beginning of the series, having sought out his bastard half-brother Ramsay (Domeric having always wanted a brother of his own). With no other trueborn heirs, Roose brought Ramsay to the Dreadfort and began to treat him as his heir.\n\nThe sigil of House Bolton in the books is a red flayed man on a field of pink with red blood drops. The TV series design has specified that the flayed man is displayed hanging upside down on an X-shaped cross. The color scheme in the TV series is slightly different: it is a red flayed man, but hanging upside-down on a white X-shaped cross with a black background.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nHouse_Bolton.png\u00e2&euro;&#x17D;|HBO viewers guide icon for House Bolton.\nHouse Bolton tourney.jpg|The banner of House Bolton at the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]] in &quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;.\nBolton_banner.jpg|House Bolton banner from a promotional image released by HBO.\nHouse-Bolton-sigil-small.png|The sigil of House Bolton as it appears in the HBO Viewer's Guide.\nBolton_men3x02.jpg|Bolton horsemen carrying the Bolton sigil in &quot;[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]&quot;\nBolton-map-marker.jpg|A map-marker used to represent House Bolton forces.\nFile:Robb_Wind.png|Bolton men also take part in the final mockery of the King in the North (see to the right)\nBolton.jpg|The flayed man of House Bolton.\nHouse-Bolton-wax-seal.jpg|A letter, sealed with wax, and bearing the sigil of House Bolton.\nBolton-shields.png|Shields emblazoned with the Flayed Man of the Dreadfort.\nHouse Bolton Season 5 promo pic.jpg|House Bolton in Season 5:  Lord Roose, his bastard son Ramsay, and Roose's new wife Walda Frey.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Members": "* [[Roose Bolton]], the head of House Bolton, [[Lord of the Dreadfort]], [[Warden]], and [[Lord Paramount of the North]].\n** {[[Domeric Bolton]]}, his trueborn son and heir.
