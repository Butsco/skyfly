Later, [[Oberyn Martell]] visits him as well and tells him that Cersei has tried to buy his vote in the judgment. Then, Oberyn reveals that he will fight against [[the Mountain]] at [[Second Trial by Combat of Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion's trial by combat]], in order to avenge the deaths of his sister Elia and her children.\n**Chapter 80, Sansa\u00c2\u00a0VII: [[Sansa]]\u00c2\u00a0finds that it is snowing outside in the [[Eyrie]] and builds a castle that resembles [[Winterfell]].\u00c2\u00a0Littlefinger tells Sansa that she is more beautiful than her mother and then kisses her.

Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. 'That's not a monster,' I told Cersei, 'That's just ''a baby''.' And she said, 'He killed [[Joanna Lannister|my mother]],' and she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off, until your brother made her stop.

Tyrion then requests Jaime to bring him [[Bronn]], hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|Eyrie]].\n\nBronn visits Tyrion in the clothes of a lord, having been betrothed to [[Lollys Stokeworth]], by [[Cersei]]'s doing. He will not fight [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] (whom Cersei has chosen for her champion), believing Clegane is too dangerous for him to face, and bids farewell to Tyrion.\n\nLater, Tyrion is approached by [[Oberyn Martell]], who tells Tyrion of his disappointment in their first encounter: as children, Oberyn and his sister [[Elia Martell|Elia]] were told stories of the &quot;Lannister Monster&quot; and his extreme deformities. During a childhood visit to [[Casterly Rock]], Cersei showed Tyrion, with great ceremony, to Oberyn and Elia. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he saw no monster, just a baby. Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion killed her mother, and then cruelly assaulted\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion until Jaime stopped her. Oberyn says that he and Elia were quite disturbed at Cersei's already strong hatred toward Tyrion. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he seeks justice for the death of his sister, and Tyrion replies, &quot;You are in the wrong place.&quot;. Oberyn counters that he is in the perfect place; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister's murder are close at hand. Intending to start his revenge with Gregor Clegane, Oberyn offers his service as Tyrion's champion in the coming trial by combat.\n\n[[Gregor Clegane]], known by most as 'the Mountain', is mercilessly killing prisoners with a greatsword. [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] approaches him and thanks him for his haste in returning to [[King's Landing]] as her champion for the trial by combat. Gregor asks who he will be fighting, Cersei asks if it matters, and he shakes his head.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\n[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] is surprised by [[Daario Naharis|Daario]] in her private chambers. She feigns outrage at the intrusion, but agrees to hear his complaints. Daario laments that he is only good at two things, killing men and sleeping with women, and that he has no opportunities to pursue either strength. Dany counters that the Second Sons are currently acting as [[Meereen]]'s police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him; Daario dismisses the Second Sons' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants isn't interested. He begs Daenerys to send him and the Second Sons to make real war. Dany focuses on Daario's other proclaimed talent and orders him to remove his clothes.\n\nThe following morning, Daario bumps into [[Ser]] [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]]. He also says that it's a good time to talk to the queen, as she is in a very good mood. Jorah is not amused, but Daenerys dismisses his concerns about her intimate life. Daenerys tells Jorah that she sent Daario to take the [[Second Sons]] to [[Yunkai]] to regain control over the city and\u00c2\u00a0kill the [[Wise Masters|masters]] that have resurfaced. Jorah relates to the mercy shown by [[Eddard Stark]] for his dealings in [[slavery]] and convinces Daenerys to bring the masters to justice without execution. Daenerys considers for a moment and then tells Jorah to assign\u00c2\u00a0[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]\u00c2\u00a0as her ambassador to offer the masters a choice: they can live free in the new world she wants to create, or they can die clinging to their old one.\u00c2\u00a0The Second Sons will be stationed in Yunkai to enforce whichever choice the masters make. She also says to let Daario know that it was Jorah who changed her mind.\n\n===At Dragonstone===\nQueen [[Selyse Florent|Selyse]] speaks to [[Melisandre]], who is enjoying a bath. She quips that the Lord of Light told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over Selyse's head. To cement\u00c2\u00a0Selyse's\u00c2\u00a0position as Melisandre's most devoted follower, the Red Priestess tells her\u00c2\u00a0about using potions and illusions in serving the\u00c2\u00a0[[Lord of Light]]\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on. Selyse asks her if she used the potions when she slept with Stannis, to which she replies that she did not. Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]] behind when they go to [[the North]] but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's\u00c2\u00a0&quot;heresy&quot; as she always is, and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going.\n\n===In the Riverlands===\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor]] encounter a \u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;[[Dying man (Mockingbird)|dying man]] in a ransacked village. Sandor gives the man a gift of mercy by stabbing him in the heart. Sandor is ambushed by [[Biter]], and is bitten on the neck. He snaps Biter's neck and drops him dead in the dirt. [[Rorge]] encounters them and after a short interrogation is killed by Arya with a quick thrust by [[Needle]] to his heart. Afterward, Sandor clumsily addresses his wounds from Biter. Arya suggests burning to cauterize the wound, but is rebuffed by Sandor's fear of fire. Sandor confirms the story of his facial scars from burns inflicted by Gregor's wrath and how his father covered up the truth, making him feel alone. Arya offers to clean and stitch him up, and Sandor allows her to.\n\nMeanwhile,\u00c2\u00a0[[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] and [[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than\u00c2\u00a0[[Hot Pie]], who proceeds\u00c2\u00a0to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients. He then asks of Brienne's business, to which she replies that she is in [[Catelyn Stark|Lady Stark's]] service to find and protect Sansa Stark. Hot Pie leaves after addressing the Starks as traitors. As Brienne and Podrick prepare to leave the inn, Podrick reminds Brienne that telling people of their quest could be dangerous, but Brienne's honesty is swiftly rewarded when Hot Pie approaches and gives them a baked good shaped like a wolf. He tells them that he knows nothing of Sansa but last saw Arya alive and hints that she was being sought by the Hound. Podrick, having memorized the complex family trees of the Great Houses, suggests that they head to the Eyrie, realizing that Lysa Arryn is the Hound's only remaining chance of a ransom.\n\n===At the Wall===\n[[Jon Snow|Jon]] and his fellow brothers return from [[Craster's Keep]]. In first sight of his direwolf, [[Ghost]], [[Alliser Thorne]] sends his &quot;beast&quot; away, outside [[Castle Black]].\n\nAfterwards, Jon tries to convince the [[Night's Watch]] to barricade [[the Wall]] against the imminent [[Wilding|wildling]] invasion by blocking off Castle Black's entry tunnel with ice and rock. He is denied after being reminded of his place in the Watch, when the [[First Builder]] reluctantly agrees with Thorne's assessment of their chances of defending the tunnel. Jon and [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] are sent to serve as sentries on top of the Wall until [[Mance Rayder|Mance]] arrives.\n\n===At the Eyrie===\nWhile wandering the Eyrie's snow-covered courtyards, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] builds a snow replica of [[Winterfell]]. [[Robin Arryn|Robin]] chances upon her and seems impressed with her efforts. The cousins get along until Robin asks where the [[Moon Door]] is. Sansa tells him Winterfell doesn't have a Moon Door. Robin insists her replica needs a Moon Door. Sansa agrees to add one, but in the process, Robin accidentally knocks over a castle tower. This irritates Sansa and Robin throws a tantrum in response. Unable to control her anger, Sansa slaps Robin. Robin threatens to tell his mother and runs away. [[Petyr Baelish]] witnesses the action and assures Sansa that he will deal with [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]], who he says should discipline her child more often anyway. Petyr muses on how he should have been Sansa's father, but then tells Sansa that she is more beautiful than her mother Catelyn and kisses Sansa; who is so shocked that she doesn't resist. Unknown to the pair, the kiss is seen by Lysa. Later, Sansa is summoned by Lysa, who proceeds to explain the gory details about Moon Door executions. Lysa then grabs Sansa and threatens to throw her out for kissing Petyr. She is stopped when Petyr arrives and swears by everything he can think of that he will send Sansa away. Lysa releases Sansa and embraces Petyr, who assures Lysa that he only ever loved one woman - [[Catelyn Stark|her sister]]. Lysa has only an instant to contemplate this betrayal, as Petyr shoves her out of the Moon Door and looks down as she plummets to her death hundreds of feet below.\n\n", "Notes": "*The title is a reference to the personal sigil\u00c2\u00a0Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\u00c2\u00a0chose for himself, that of the mockingbird. As Lord Baelish is the sole member of his house, it has become the sigil associated with [[House Baelish]].\n*This episode continues a curious trend, in that the TV series has made no mention so far that unlike the rest of Westeros, Dorne practices equal primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child succeeds to a lordship regardless of gender. In the books, the current head of [[House Blackmont]] in Dorne is a woman, but the TV series changed &quot;[[Blackmont (Lord)|Lord Blackmont]]&quot; to be a man when Tyrion meets the Dornish embassy in the Season 4 premiere. In this episode, Oberyn says that his ''father'' took him and Elia on a visit to Casterly Rock, when in the books, it was their ''mother'' - and Oberyn's mother was actually the Ruling Princess of Dorne in her own right, inherited from her parents. Oberyn's mother and Tyrion's mother [[Joanna Lannister]] were great friends at the time because they had both served as handmaidens to Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen]] (Daenerys's mother). Of course, this does not preclude the possibility that Oberyn's mother was also present at Casterly Rock or that the [[Dornishmen]] practice equal primogeniture.\n**On top of this, Bronn says that [[Lollys Stokeworth]] may have an older sister, Falyse, but if Falyse dies before her father then Castle Stokeworth will pass to Lollys (and her husband Bronn). In the books, however, the current head of House Stokeworth is Falyse and Lollys's ''mother'', the aged Tanda Stokeworth. It is unclear if this is some sort of conscious decision by the writers to remove female rulers from the TV series.\n*[[Bronn]] is one of the few characters in the entire series whose fortunes are consistently better at the end of each novel/season. He started out as a common [[Mercenary|sellsword]] at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], only owning what he could carry. He answered Catelyn Stark's call for men to escort her and the captive Tyrion to the Eyrie, but by fighting and winning as Tyrion's champion in a trial by combat there, he entered into Tyrion's service - and by the end of Season 1 had become a direct retainer of one of the leading members of House Lannister. In Season 2, apart from being the chief bodyguard of the acting Hand of the King, he was briefly put in charge of the City Watch. At the beginning of Season 3, his social position was considerably elevated when he was [[Knighthood|knighted]] for his vital role repulsing Stannis's attack on the city, becoming &quot;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater&quot;. Now, due to Cersei's bribe, Bronn has married the younger sister of one of the major noble families from the Crownlands (and he is hoping to eventually ensure that his wife becomes ''the'' heir to House Stokeworth). To put this in perspective, along with House Rosby, House Stokeworth provides much of the food supply to nearby King's Landing: in terms of wealth and soldiers at their command, the Stokeworths are on the same level as [[House Umber]] or [[House Karstark]].\n**The question &quot;who do you think will end up on the Iron Throne at the end of the story?&quot; is commonly asked about the series. Among the book fandom, Bronn's steady rise in power has led to the half-serious joke that at the rate he's going, he should be included on the short list of characters who might actually take the throne by the end of the story.\n*[[Hot Pie]]'s reappearance in this episode includes several callbacks to his last appearance (not including the point when he explicitly summarizes to Brienne all of his travels with Arya since leaving King's Landing). In his last appearance in Season 3's &quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;, he also mispronounced &quot;Winterfell&quot; as &quot;Winter-hell&quot;, and he made Arya a loaf of bread that was (allegedly) shaped like a direwolf (as he says in this episode, his latest attempt came out a lot better). Hot Pie also asks if Brienne is a knight because she is wearing armor: in Season 2 episode 2, &quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;, Hot Pie similarly thought that a man he knew was a knight just because he was wearing armor, though [[Gendry]] tried to explain to him that anyone can just ''buy'' and wear armor, without being a knight.\n**Hot Pie was actually introduced in the Season 1 finale, and as of this episode has appeared at least once in every season of the series. This also means that he is one of a steadily decreasing number of recurring characters who were introduced in Season 1, reappeared in every season, and who are still alive (the same cannot be said of Joffrey).\n*[[Ben Hawkey]] (Hot Pie) explained that the production team wanted a direwolf-shaped bread that looked exactly right (because the joke is that it looks so much more neat than his last attempt) but it would have wasted far too much time to just make one after another until one turned out well enough to use. Therefore, they actually baked something like 70 separate direwolf-bread loaves all at once on the day of filming, then picked the one they felt had turned out the best.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2014/5/30/all-men-must-dine-19-questions-for-ben-hawkey-aka-hot-pie MakingGameofThrones.com]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*[[Rorge]] and his sidekick [[Biter]] are actually major characters in the fourth novel. After they were taken to Harrenhal, they joined the infamous sellsword company known as the Brave Companions, led by Vargo Hoat. In the TV series, Hoat was changed to simply be a Bolton soldier named [[Locke]], who later died at the Wall attempting to assassinate Jon Snow and Bran Stark (while in the books, the Mountain took over Harrenhal at Tywin's command and horrifically tortured Hoat to death for his mutilation of Jaime). A major subplot in the fourth novel, ''A Feast for Crows'', focuses on Brienne of Tarth's long and difficult search for the Stark sisters while roaming the war-ravaged and lawless Riverlands. As seen in Arya's storyline in Season 4, bandits are now roaming the devastated countryside at will: with the Starks defeated, the Brave Companions turn into the worst of these bandits, burning entire towns in their wake. This turns into a series of encounters in which Brienne personally fights and kills four of the Brave Companions - but never bringing her closer to finding the Stark girls. Within one episode, however, the TV series has made it clear that it will condense this entire long and slow-moving subplot: Rorge and Biter are killed off right away, and the first episode to focus on Brienne's search for the Stark girls ends with her already receiving the accurate tip that she should search for them at the Eyrie.\n**Season 3 is adapting the second half of the third novel, but Brienne's narrative in it actually ended with her departure on her quest along with the sword Oathkeeper. At this point she is approaching the end of her narrative from the fourth novel, though certain other plotlines have also moved beyond where they ended in the third novel (i.e. Bran Stark actually passed north of the Wall at the very end of the third novel).\n*Ironically, in the TV continuity, Brienne might actually have found Arya Stark if she simply stayed where she was. Arya and the Hound are trying to travel from the Twins to the Eyrie, and the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] is located right along their way: the eastern branch of the &quot;crossroads&quot; that the inn is located on is in fact the [[Eastern Road]], the main and ''only'' highway to the Eyrie. The Hound does appear to be going cross-country and avoiding major towns and inns, however: he mentioned four episodes ago that they were approaching [[Fairmarket]], which means they went south then east from the Twins, following the Blue Fork of the Trident River, instead of going east then south along the [[Kingsroad]] (which leads directly to the Inn at the Crossroads).\n*Actor [[Brian Fortune]] appears during the Night's Watch meeting as First Builder [[Othell Yarwyck]], and the episode makes it a point to have Ser Alliser prominently introduce him by name. Fortune previously appeared in Season 1 as an unnamed Night's Watch officer, but who had prominent speaking lines (he officiated when Jon and Sam swore their vows before a heart three). While the character was officially unnamed, at the time Fortune said that the writers told him he was playing Bowen Marsh, who is the First Steward and another prominent member of the Night's Watch. Based on this information, up until Season 4 ''Game of Thrones Wiki'' treated him as playing Bowen Marsh, but it has now been directly and clearly established in on-screen dialogue that he is actually playing Othell Yarwyck. The exact reason behind the change isn't clear. While this is a retcon, it actually doesn't significantly contradict previous information, because Fortune's character wasn't referred to by name in Season 1.\n*It is mentioned for the second time how the Hound's face was burned. Previously Littlefinger told it to Sansa, while Arya listened, in &quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;. Sandor's speech explaining how his face was burned was actually used for [[Rory McCann]]'s audition tape. Due to bad weather while filming the tournament, however, the scene had to be scrapped. It was later replaced in pickups with the invented scene of Littlefinger revealing Sandor's past to Sansa (a story which Sandor has told almost no one). In &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot; Arya tells the Hound &quot;I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop&quot;.\n*Beginning with this episode,\u00c2\u00a0the role of Gregor Clegane has been taken over by Icelandic strongman [[Haf\u0102\u017e\u0102\u0142r J\u0102\u015fl\u0102\u00adus Bj\u0102\u015brnsson]]. The role was played by [[Conan Stevens]] in Season 1, but he left the series to appear as the Orc leader Bolg in the ''Hobbit'' film trilogy. For Season 2, the role of Gregor was taken over by [[Ian Whyte]], one of the stunt men on the series who has also appeared as [[White Walkers]] and [[Giants]].\n*This marks the first time that Petyr Baelish has directly killed a character. Although he can be considered to be the\u00c2\u00a0architect of the War of the Five Kings, he has not killed anyone personally (at least not on-screen).\u00c2\u00a0However, he is responsible for the deaths of many:\n**Season 1: Under Baelish's direction, Lysa Arryn killed her husband [[Jon Arryn|Jon]] by putting [[Tears of Lys]] in his wine\u00c2\u00a0and then sent a note to\u00c2\u00a0Catelyn blaming the\u00c2\u00a0[[House Lannister|Lannisters]] (not confirmed until season 4). He also betrayed\u00c2\u00a0Ned Stark, who was then executed by\u00c2\u00a0Ser\u00c2\u00a0Ilyn\u00c2\u00a0Payne at King\u00c2\u00a0Joffrey's\u00c2\u00a0command.\n**Season 2: Thousands of casualties in the War of the Five Kings, which is set off as a result of his machinations. This number may extend into the tens of thousands if numbers are included from all of the commoners who died when the Riverlands were burned out during the course of the war, and the resulting food shortages.\n**Season 3: Upon learning that Ros was informing on him to Varys, he gives her to Joffrey to torture and kill.\n**Season 4: Littlefinger masterminded the poisoning of King\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Joffrey. Shortly after the King's death, he had his guards kill\u00c2\u00a0Ser\u00c2\u00a0Dontos after he delivered\u00c2\u00a0Sansa\u00c2\u00a0Stark to him.\n*The dialogue in Arya and Sandor's scene with a [[Dying man|dying farmer]] is apparently in reference to avant-garde Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's ''[[Wikipedia:Waiting for Godot|Waiting for Godot]]''. Actor [[Barry McGovern]], who plays the dying farmer, has appeared in several stage productions of the play, as well as a 2001 film adaptation of it. A similar event occurred in the books, but with different dialogue: immediately after the [[Red Wedding]], Arya and Sandor come across a bowman from House Piper who managed to escape from the main massacre but is slowly dying from his mortal wounds, and Sandor gives him the mercy of a quick death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observationdeck.io9.com/waiting-for-got-dot-1578297724/1578773827/+charliejane io9.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/25yzjh/spoilers_asos_parallels_between_s4e7_and_waiting/ Parallels with ''Waiting for Godot'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Season 4 Blu-ray commentary confirms that Benioff and Weiss specifically named Barry McGovern for the role in the script, and that they are fans of Samuel Beckett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/game-of-thrones/243771/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Oberyn claims that the Mountain killed both of Elia's children; in the books, it was [[Aegon Targaryen (Son of Rhaegar)|baby Aegon]] and Elia herself whom Gregor killed, while [[Amory Lorch]] killed [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]]. The TV series apparently condensed this so that Ser Gregor was responsible for killing both of Elia's children.\n*Oberyn Martell makes an off-hand mention to Tyrion that during his trip to Casterly Rock, which was the first time he traveled outside of Dorne, he didn't like anything about it: &quot;not the food, not the weather, not your accents&quot;. The novels do mention that [[Dornishmen]] speak the [[Common Tongue]] of Westeros with a pronounced accent (consistently referred to as a &quot;Dornish drawl&quot;). The [[Rhoynar]] ancestors of the modern Dornishmen spoke their own language, and though they adopted the use of the Common Tongue of the [[Andals]] when they migrated to Westeros it still left a distinct regional accent (similar to how both the [[Northmen]] and the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] seem to have an &quot;[[Old Tongue]] accent&quot; which sounds like a Northern England accent, because both groups descent from the [[First Men]]). Moreover, Dorne remained unconquered by the Targaryens for two centuries, only uniting with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms one century ago. The combined result of this geographical, ethnic, cultural, and political isolation is a very pronounced regional accent. Oberyn's anecdote also highlights that conceptions of &quot;accent&quot; are subjective: he considers fellow Dornishmen to be speaking normally, and that it's the rest of Westeros that speaks with an odd accent.\n*Up until this episode, both Sandor Clegane (The Hound) and\u00c2\u00a0Ser Gregor Clegane\u00c2\u00a0(The Mountain) have been fully armored in all of their scenes on the show. The Mountain, despite his short appearance in this episode, is shirtless and is wearing only trousers and boots. The Hound, after being bit by [[Biter]], is seen tending his wound with hardly any armor and only his undershirt on. Essentially, this is the first episode where both Clegane brothers have a scene while wearing no armor.\n*The final scene of the episode in which Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion in his cell was actually actor [[Pedro Pascal]]'s first day of filming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26gtvt/i_am_actor_pedro_pascal_i_play_oberyn_in_game_of/Pedro Pascal Reddit AMA]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The official blooper reel for Season 4 revealed that during the final scene when Oberyn visits Tyrion in his cell, in one take Pedro Pascal accidentally leaned too far backwards against a wooden beam, so that he knocked the flaming torch on the side of the beam nearly out of its holder. Pascal narrowly avoided having the flaming torch land directly onto his shoulder, or lighting his hair on fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtu.be/v-7Fs9HJvs0?t=51s Season 4 blooper real from SDCC], 51 seconds into the clip]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*It is odd that the TV series would have Arya's name openly announced when she and Sandor reach the Bloody Gate: Littlefinger and Sansa used much more discretion, having her sneak into the Eyrie under an assumed name, because they were afraid that if anyone overheard that one of the Stark girls was in the Vale the news would eventually be reported to the Lannisters. Strangely, this issue is never addressed again in Season 4, nor were there apparently any repercussions. Westeros.org's official review felt it was simply a plot hole, given that Arya has spent the past three seasons keeping her real identity a carefully guarded secret.\n*The snow model of Winterfell that Sansa makes was constructed by the props department out of Epsom and cooking salt. They had to make six copies of the model, for each take in which Sweetrobin destroys it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/game-of-thrones/243771/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Video gallery": "&lt;gallery widths=&quot;300&quot; hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nGame of Thrones Mockingbird - Fan Vs.
