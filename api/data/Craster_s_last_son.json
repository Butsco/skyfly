However, no such event has ever been witnessed in the books so far.\n\n[[Craster's wives]] do say that they ''believe'' that the infant sons that Craster gave the Others as sacrifices were turned into new White Walkers - but it wasn't clear if this is what ''actually'' happens, or if it was just the wild suspicion of Craster's frightened, isolated wives. When Samwell is told to flee with Gilly and her newborn son, Gilly urges that if he doesn't &quot;they&quot; will come for him. When he asks who &quot;they&quot; are, another wife says: &quot;The boy's brothers...Craster's sons. The white cold's rising out there, crow. I can feel it in my bones. These poor old bones don't lie. They'll be here soon, the sons.&quot;\n\nConfirmation of what exactly happens to Craster's sons has not occurred in the books yet.\n\n==\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Appearance==\n{{Template:Season Four Appearances||||yes}}\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nThis baby is the last male offspring of the [[Free Folk|wildling]] [[Craster]], killed by [[Karl Tanner]] of the [[Night's Watch]] during the [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|mutiny]] in which the old wildling was killed.
