Lions feature prominently in Westerosi [[heraldry]], such as the sigils of [[House Lannister]], [[House Grandison]] and the extinct [[House Reyne]].\n\nLord [[Tytos Lannister]] was nearly killed by a lioness but was saved by the [[Clegane  (founder)|kennelmaster]] of [[Casterly Rock]].\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels lions inhabited the [[Westerlands|western hills]] of [[Westeros]] but have been nearly hunted down to extinction. One famously attacked Lord Tytos Lannister, Tywin's father, but even in those days they were considered rare. Their numbers declined further in later years, and they may be extinct in the wild of Westeros. When Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] was a child, caged lions were kept in the bowels of [[Casterly Rock]], a legacy from the days of her grandfather Tytos.\n\nIn contrast, wild lion populations apparently still thrive in many of the open regions of Essos. The plains of the [[Dothraki Sea]] are inhabited by a white subspecies of lion, called ''hrakkar'' by the [[Dothraki]]. Lions are also a common sight in many private collections in the cities of Essos, either for display or for combat in [[Fighting pit|fighting pits]]. The [[Prince of Pentos]] is mentioned to keep a pride of lions in his private menagerie.\n\nIn real life, lions inhabited southern Europe until historic times, when human encroachment gradually drove them to extinction. The Roman Empire's demand for lions and other big animals to fight and die in colosseums also played a large role in diminishing their numbers.\n\n"}, "title": "Lions"}
