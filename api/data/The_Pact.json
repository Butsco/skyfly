The First Men also agreed not to cut down a [[weirwood]] ever again.\n\nTo commemorate the Pact, the Children carved faces into every weirwood of the island, which would become known as the [[Isle of Faces]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Complete Guide to Westeros]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "The Pact"}
