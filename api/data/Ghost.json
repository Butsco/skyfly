That one's yours, Snow.|[[Theon Greyjoy]] to [[Jon Snow]]|Winter is Coming}}\n'''Ghost''' is one of six [[direwolf]] cubs that are found by the children of [[House Stark]]. Ghost is adopted and raised by [[Jon Snow]]. Ghost is an albino, with white fur and red eyes. He was the runt of the litter when he was born, though he quickly grew to be as big as the rest of his siblings.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ghost is the quietest and stealthiest of the six wolf cubs. While the other wolves are darker-colored, Ghost is an albino and initially appears to be the runt of the litter, though he grows up to be as big as any of the others. Ghost's like-but-unlike nature appeals to Jon as a kindred spirit. Ghost's appearance is said to resemble that of the faces found on [[heart tree]]s in [[the North]].\n\nJon finds him separated from his siblings, as he matured faster than the others: he was the first to open his eyes and walk on his own, and was attempting to find shelter away from their mother's corpse. Like Jon Snow, the bastard &quot;outsider&quot; of his family, as the runt of the litter, Ghost had to grow up fast.\n\nIn the books, it is emphasized that Ghost is unnaturally silent: Jon tells Tyrion that he named him &quot;Ghost&quot; partially because of his albino coloring, but also because of how little noise he makes. In the books, Ghost is completely mute, utterly silent making no sound of any kind. This wasn't found to translate well to the screen, so Ghost makes noises like growling at [[Rast]] in his bunk or whining at [[Gilly]] holding rabbits.\n\nGhost accompanies Jon when he joins Qhorin's scouting group. Ghost participates in the killing of Qhorin and remains with Jon as he infiltrates Mance Rayder's host. Before going with the wildlings to scale the Wall, Jon orders Ghost to leave and attempt to return to [[Castle Black]]. Ghost obeys and departs into the forest. A few days after the battle of Castle Black is over, Ghost returns, and the two are overjoyed to be reunited.\n\nIn the TV series, Ghost initially shadows Qhorin's scouting group, but he does not appear again after Jon is captured. Apparently, on his own initiative Ghost made his way back to the Fist of the First Men, the Watch's main base camp, but it had come under attack by the White Walkers. Ghost is later seen with the survivors, when he helps Jeor Mormont kill a wight that was attacking Samwell. Ghost apparently then tried to return to Castle Black alongside them, but when they reach Craster's Keep, Ghost somehow senses the coming danger, and retreats back into the Haunted Forest. He is currently back in Castle Black together with Jon Snow after assault on Craster's\u00c2\u00a0Keep.\n\n", "Gallery": "&lt;gallery widths=&quot;175&quot; spacing=&quot;small&quot;&gt;\nKitasJonSnowEW.png|Photoshoot of Kit Harington as Jon Snow and a digitally enlarged wolf as Ghost.\nGhost on a hill.jpg|Ghost on the [[Fist of the First Men]].\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", " Biography ": "===[[Season 1]]===\n[[File:Screen_Shot_2013-06-16_at_12.18.27_AM.png|thumb|left|Jon Snow finds Ghost as a pup]]\n\nAfter five direwolf puppies are found by [[Robb Stark|Robb S]][[Robb Stark|tark]] and taken, one for each one of the [[House Stark|Stark]] children, Jon Snow finds an albino direwolf pup, the runt of the litter.
