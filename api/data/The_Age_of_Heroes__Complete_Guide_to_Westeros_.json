It is narrated by [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as [[Bran Stark]].\n\n", "Synopsis": "[[Bran Stark]] recounts the stories of legendary figures of several of the seven independent kingdoms that existed prior to the [[War of Conquest]].\n\n", "Summary": "When [[Aegon the Conqueror]] launched his [[War of Conquest|invasion]] of [[Westeros]] he faced seven independent kingdoms: the [[Kingdom of the North]], the [[Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]], the Kingdom of the [[Iron Islands]] and the [[Riverlands]], the [[Kingdom of the Rock]], the [[Kingdom of the Reach]], the Kingdom of the [[Stormlands]], and [[Dorne]]. Some of these kingdoms had been established thousands of years before, in the [[Age of Heroes]].\n\nOne hero of this legendary age was [[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Bran the Builder]]. He raised [[the Wall]] and built [[Winterfell]], founding [[House Stark]] and reigning as the first [[King in the North]].\n\nOther legends speak of the [[Grey King]] in the [[Iron Islands]], who took a mermaid to wife and defeated [[Nagga]], the first sea dragon. [[House Greyjoy]] of [[Pyke]], current rulers of the Isles boast descent from him.\n\n[[House Casterly]] ruled the [[Westerlands]] from their seat of [[Casterly Rock]]. However, they were swindled from lands and power by the trickster [[Lann the Clever]]. [[House Lannister]] is said to descend from him.\n\n[[The Reach]] and all its fertile lands were first ruled by [[House Gardener]]. [[Garth Gardener|Garth Greenhand]], founder of the House, wore a crown of flowers and vine. He ruled as the first [[King of the Reach]] from his seat of [[Highgarden]] and was said to have made the land bloom. Many noble houses trace their descent back to him, including [[House Tyrell]], the current lords of Highgarden.\n\nCertain ballads of the [[Stormlands]] tell of a warrior named [[Durran]] who fell in love with [[Elenei]], daughter of the God of the Sea and the Goddess of the Wind. She became a mortal after giving him her maidenhead. Enraged, Elenei's parents called upon a massive storm and destroyed Durran's bayside keep as a &quot;wedding gift&quot;. Durran declared war on the gods and rebuilt his keep, which was also destroyed. He raised four more castles, each stronger than the previous but all these too fell to the power of the gods. Durran's [[Storm's End|seventh castle]], however, withstood the gods' rage. Durran became known as &quot;Durran Godsgrief&quot; and reigned as the first [[Storm King]].\n\nThere are countless other tales from the Age of Heroes, histories never recorded in a book but passed from generation to generation through stories and songs. While some of them may be dismissed as fairy tales, each of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] is nevertheless defined by them.\n\n"}, "title": "The Age of Heroes (Complete Guide to Westeros)"}
