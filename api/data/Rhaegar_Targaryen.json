And Rhaegar died.|Jorah Mormont|Walk of Punishment}}\n'''Rhaegar Targaryen''' is an unseen character in ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He is deceased when the events of the series commence. He was the son and heir of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], holding the title of Prince of [[Dragonstone]]. Rhaegar was the older brother of [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], though Daenerys was born after he died. He was the last great champion of [[House Targaryen]].\n\nRhaegar is blamed for starting [[Robert's Rebellion]] by\u00c2\u00a0[[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducting]] [[Lyanna Stark]]. He was killed by [[Robert Baratheon]] at the climax of the war.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Rhaegar is depicted as a chivalrous, honorable, well loved by the smallfolk and just warrior, albeit one often distracted by other concerns and apparently unable or unwilling to restrain the worst excesses of his father. He had a strained relationship with his father, which was helped along by the king's paranoia, and lords who spoke ill of the Crown Prince and claimed he was plotting to overthrow Aerys.\n\nRhaegar had silver-gold hair and dark lilac eyes. He was considered to be tall and handsome. [[Cersei Lannister]],\u00c2\u00a0who was infatuated with him, remembers Rhaegar as the most beautiful man she had ever seen. Rhaegar was very bookish in his youth, such that people jested that the Queen swallowed some books and a candle while he was in her wombs. As a boy he was able to impress the maesters with his wit.\u00c2\u00a0He was married to Princess Elia\u00c2\u00a0Martell of [[Dorne]], with whom he had two children, Rhaenys and Aegon. It is suggested that he was not in love with Elia but was fond of her nonetheless.\n\nRhaegar's reasons for kidnapping Lyanna Stark remain a mystery to both his supporters and his detractors, but the entire realm knows that they had met at a great tourney at the castle of [[Harrenhal]] a year before the kidnapping. Rhaegar had crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty, passing over his wife.\n\nA year after the tourney, Rhaegar and two knights of the Kingsguard fell upon Lyanna in the Riverlands and kidnapped her. This event is cited as the catalyst for Robert's Rebellion. After initially hiding in Dorne during the majority of the war, Rhaegar was summoned to lead the Royalist forces in what would be the Battle of the Trident. Robert killed him in single combat during the battle. With his death and the loss of the battle, the Targaryen cause was seen as doomed. With this decisive rebel victory, the Lannisters and Greyjoys, who had stayed out of the conflict, joined the war on the rebels' side. This led to the Greyjoy raid of the Reach, as well as the Lannister's Sack of King's Landing and the death of Aerys.\n\nWhen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] was in the [[House of the Undying]], one of the visions she saw was a man resembling [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] but taller than him, with dark indigo eyes, and a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. They were confirmed to be Rhaegar, Elia, and their infant son Aegon.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|In my dreams, I kill him every night.|[[Robert Baratheon]] to [[Eddard Stark]]|Winter is Coming}}\n\n{{Quote|Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon.|[[Jorah Mormont]] to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]|Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things}}\n\n{{Quote|When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him.
