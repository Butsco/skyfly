It was founded during the time of the [[First Men]] by [[Garth Gardener|Garth Greenhand]], the first [[King of the Reach]], who was said to have the ability to make the land bloom.\n\nFollowing the [[Andal Invasion]], the Kingdom of the Reach came to be dominated by [[Andal]] culture, though the [[House Gardener|Gardener]] dynasty remained in power. The Kingdom of the Reach fell when [[Aegon the Conqueror]] defeated the last Gardener King, [[Mern Gardener|Mern IX]], in the [[Field of Fire]]. [[The Reach]] fell under the authority of the [[Iron Throne]] and [[House Tyrell]] replaced the extinct Gardeners as rulers of the Reach.\n[[Category:Kingdoms|Reach, Kingdom of the]]\n[[Category:Map Needed]]"}, "title": "Kingdom of the Reach"}
