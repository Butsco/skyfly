It is an inlet of the [[Shivering Sea]]. It separates the southern coast of [[the North]] from the northern coast of the [[Vale of Arryn]], with [[the Neck]] running along the western edge of the bay. The islands known as [[the Three Sisters]] are located within the Bite.\n\nSeveral northern settlements are on the coastland of the Bite. The castle [[Widow's Watch]] is on a peninsula that projects into the northern mouth of the bay. The city of [[White Harbor]] lies at the estuary of the [[White Knife]] river on the northern edge of the Bite. The town [[Ramsgate]] lies at the estuary of the [[Broken Branch]] river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/moat-cailin/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Moat Cailin entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe [[Fingers]] peninsulas project into the southern mouth of the bay. Beyond the bay lies the [[Shivering Sea]], which extends to the north of [[Essos]], beyond the limits of [[the known world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/the-vale-of-arryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, The Vale of Arryn entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "References": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels the Bite is in the same location.
