Clear, tasteless and odorless. Dissolved in wine or water, it eats at a man's bowels. He dies in agony. Which will not appear unusual if the victim is old and sickly.

It causes extreme sickness in the bowels and belly, and kills very quickly. Not only is it difficult for the intended target to detect, its effects are subtle enough that they are easily mistaken for a very sudden and severe fever. Even upon examination of the corpse, it is difficult to discern if someone has been killed using tears of Lys.\n\n"}, "title": "Tears of Lys"}
