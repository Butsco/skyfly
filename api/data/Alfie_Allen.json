He is the son of actor and comedian [[wikipedia:Keith Allen|Keith Allen]] and the brother of singer [[wikipedia:Lily Allen|Lily Allen]]. His most notable role so far has been a well-received 2009 stint as the lead in the play ''[[wikipedia:Equus (play)|Equus]].''\n\nHe stars in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Theon Greyjoy]]. He was announced in the role on 20 August 2009. He was part of the initial starring cast and has remained a member appearing on all subsequent seasons since.\n\nAllen explained that Theon hasn't seen his own father [[Balon Greyjoy]] in nine years since he was a small child, so logically he doesn't know him very well. Therefore, as part of method acting, Allen intentionally avoided actor [[Patrick Malahide]], who plays Balon, at all times except for when they were actually shooting scenes in front of the cameras, to maintain a level of unfamiliarity and uncertainty between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/the-daily-raven-special-interview-with-alfie-allen/ Alfie Allen Post-Season 2 interview]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n", "See also": "*{{Template:WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 0654295}}\n*{{Template:Twitter\n|# = AlfieAllen}}\n\n", "Videos": "[[File:Game of Thrones - Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy Answers IGN Fan Questions|center|550 px]]\n&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;\n"}, "title": "Alfie Allen"}
