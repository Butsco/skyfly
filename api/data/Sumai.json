It allows a resident of the city to vouch for outsiders who wish to enter it. The one who invokes it must cut the palm of a hand and show the wound.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of Sumai or any similar blood oath. Daenerys is not refused entrance into Qarth. On the contrary, she's welcomed and well treated because her dragons are considered a marvel.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\n[[File:Xaro_invokes_sumai.png|thumb|Xaro invokes Sumai.]][[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\u00c2\u00a0invokes Sumai to vouch for [[Daenerys Targaryen]], her ''[[khalasar]]'', and her [[dragons]], to allow them to enter [[Qarth]] after [[the Thirteen]] refuse them entrance into the city.\u00c2\u00a0The\u00c2\u00a0[[Spice King]]\u00c2\u00a0comments &quot;be it on your head&quot;, suggesting that Xaro\u00c2\u00a0shall take the full responsibility for allowing Daenerys'\u00c2\u00a0party in.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Sumai"}
