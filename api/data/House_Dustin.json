House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes, beneath a black crown.|[[Arya Stark]] to [[Tywin Lannister]]|The Ghost of Harrenhal}}\n'''House Dustin''' of [[Barrowton]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. They control Barrowton, a settlement in the [[Barrowlands]], north of [[Blazewater Bay]].\n\nThe only known member of House Dustin is the Lady of the house, [[Barbrey Ryswell]].\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Dustin are the rulers of Barrowton. They have a vassal house of their own, House Stout of Goldgrass. House Dustin is ruled by [[Lady Barbrey Dustin]], widow of Willam Dustin, who died at the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]], killed by the [[Mad King]]'s surviving [[Kingsguard]] at the Mountains of [[Dorne]].\n\n[[Brandon Stark (Son of Rickard)|Brandon Stark]] was fostered during his youth at Barrowton by House Dustin and Barbrey Ryswell was besotted by him. She hoped to marry him, but this was dashed when he was betrothed to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]]. Barbrey instead was left to marry Lord William Dustin, whose lands are on the eastern border of House Ryswell's. Following William's death at the end of the rebellion, it isn't clear if he had any heirs, as Lady Barbrey appears to rule Barrowton in his name. As a result, Lady Barbrey leads House Dustin to closely follow neighboring House Ryswell in political decisions, as its current lord,\u00c2\u00a0Rodrik, is her own father.\n\nLady Dustin holds a grudge against [[Eddard Stark]] for not bringing her husband's bones north with him so she could bury him at his ancestral home.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\nWhile posing as a cupbearer to [[Tywin Lannister]] at [[Harrenhal]], [[Arya Stark]] claims to be from [[Maidenpool]], the seat of [[House Mooton]]. However, Arya is not able to identify House Mooton's sigil to Tywin. She admits to being from [[the North]] instead, claiming to be a stonemason's daughter from [[Barrowton]]. She describes House Dustin's sigil perfectly, convincing Tywin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTywin later criticizes Arya's pronunciation of &quot;My lord.&quot; He says that she sounds high born but Arya counters that her mother served as a handmaid to [[Barbrey Ryswell|Lady Dustin]] for many years and taught her how to speak properly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "House Dustin"}
