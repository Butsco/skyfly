However, the production team was so enthusiastic about her performance, and the larger scale concern of having Headey play Cersei for several years, that they didn't recast the role but instead worked around her pregnancy by, for example, keeping the camera frame above her waist or having her sit at a table. For wide shots when Cersei is walking around, notice that most of Cersei's costumes in Season 1 have large billowing sleeves which she carries in front of her to hide her pregnancy. At other times, body doubles were shot from behind in quick-cuts. This may also explain why Cersei's sex scene with Jaime isn't as involved as it is in the books, in which they are both completely naked and have an extended conversation intermixed with lovemaking. In the TV series, Cersei and Jaime are mostly clothed, with Jaime simply pulling her dress up, and Jaime is taking her from behind, so the viewer can't see that the actress is pregnant.\n\n", "TOP": "Cersei Lannister02104p3a0fdfncmvb3bk0u00188fhihvluc31812552015-04-05T13:52:17ZThe Dragon Demands5014364Undo revision 181243 by [[Special:Contributions/EnglishJoker|EnglishJoker]] ([[User talk:EnglishJoker|talk]]){{Heraldry\n|leftimage = Lannister mini shield.png\n|leftlink = House Lannister\n|rightimage = Baratheon mini shield.png\n|rightlink = House Baratheon\n}}\n{{Character\n| Image = CerseiS5.png\n| Season = [[Season 1|1]], [[Season 2|2]], [[Season 3|3]], [[Season 4|4]], [[Season 5|5]]\n| First = &quot;[[Winter is Coming]]&quot;\n| Appearances = 36 episodes &lt;small&gt;[[#Appearances|(see below)]]&lt;/small&gt;\n| Status = [[:Category:Status: Alive|Alive]]\n| Titles = [[Queen]] [[Regent]]&lt;br&gt;[[Lord Paramount of the Westerlands|Lady Paramount of the Westerlands]]&lt;br&gt;[[Lord of Casterly Rock|Lady of Casterly Rock]]\n| Place = [[Casterly Rock]], [[the Westerlands]]\n| Allegiance = [[House Lannister]]&lt;br&gt;[[House Baratheon of King's Landing]] (by marriage)\n| Family = {[[Tywin Lannister]]} - father&lt;br&gt;{[[Joanna Lannister]]} - mother&lt;br&gt;{[[Tytos Lannister]]} - paternal grandfather&lt;br&gt;Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] - twin brother/lover&lt;br&gt;[[Tyrion Lannister]] - younger brother&lt;br&gt;{[[Robert Baratheon]]} - husband&lt;br&gt;{[[Cersei's black-haired son|Trueborn son with Robert]]} - died in infancy&lt;br&gt;{[[Joffrey Baratheon]]} - son/nephew&lt;br&gt;[[Myrcella Baratheon]] - daughter/niece&lt;br&gt;[[Tommen Baratheon]] - son/nephew&lt;br&gt;Ser [[Kevan Lannister]] - uncle&lt;br&gt;Ser [[Lancel Lannister]] - first cousin&lt;br&gt;{[[Martyn Lannister]]} - first cousin&lt;br&gt;{[[Willem Lannister]]} - first cousin&lt;br&gt;[[Stannis Baratheon]] - brother-in-law&lt;br&gt;{[[Renly Baratheon]]} - brother-in-law&lt;br&gt;[[Selyse Baratheon]] - sister-in-law&lt;br&gt;[[Shireen Baratheon]] - niece by marriage&lt;br&gt;[[Sansa Stark]] - sister-in-law&lt;br&gt;Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] - betrothed\n| Actor = [[Lena Headey]]&lt;br&gt;[[Nell Williams]] (Young Cersei, flashbacks in [[Season 5]])\n| Age = Approx. 41 in Season 5&lt;ref&gt;Jaime is Cersei's twin, and thus the same age as her.

She is portrayed by starring cast member [[Lena Headey]] and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming (episode)|series premiere]]. Cersei is the widow of King [[Robert Baratheon]] and Queen Regent of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. She installed her son [[Joffrey Baratheon]] on the [[Iron Throne]] under the false claim that he was a legitimate son from her marriage but he was actually the product of her [[incest]]uous relationship with her younger twin brother Ser [[Jaime Lannister]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cersei is a beautiful but also somewhat cold woman who does not get along with her husband, whom she considers to be a fat oaf. However, she dotes on and loves her three children. She is not politically skilled, and frustrated that her options for power are limited by her gender. Cersei is close to her brother Jaime, but is cowed by her father and despises Tyrion, whom she blames for killing her mother Joanna, who died in childbirth.\n\nAccording to the novels, Cersei never gave birth to any children of [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]. As she revealed to [[Eddard Stark]]\u00c2\u00a0she was only once pregnant with a child of Robert, but had the child aborted out of hatred for him. Robert was unaware to both the pregnancy and the abortion. In the TV series, she revealed to Catelyn Stark that she gave birth to a &quot;beautiful, black-haired boy&quot;, (which given her gold-haired children with Jaime, must have been Robert's son), but the infant died of a fever.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Cersei Lannister&quot; is pronounced &quot;SER-see LAN-iss-ter&quot;.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|Someday, [[Joffrey Baratheon|you'll]] sit on the [[Iron Throne|throne]], and the truth will be what you make it.|'''Cersei'''|Lord Snow}}\n{{Quote|Everyone who isn't [[House Lannister|us]] is an enemy.|'''Cersei''' to her son, [[Joffrey Baratheon]].|Lord Snow}}\n{{Quote|When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die.

Coupled with the death of her mother, this meant that Cersei and her two brothers were primarily raised by servants attached to House Lannister. She began an incestuous relationship with Jaime in her youth which has continued despite her marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cersei viewers guide&quot; /&gt; Cersei has had other partners but Jaime has always been faithful to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot;&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Robert Cersei wedding.jpg|thumb|left|Cersei marries Robert Baratheon.]]\n\nShe is the wife of [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert Baratheon]], a political marriage Robert agreed to in thanks for her father's late switching of sides in [[Robert's Rebellion|the civil war]] which brought him to power.

She and her twin brother, Jaime, discuss the situation and wonder if Jon told anyone else about what he had discovered. Jaime tells her not to worry, since if the King knew the truth they'd be dead already. She suggests that Jaime could be the next Hand, but Jaime refuses, citing the position as too much responsibility and danger.&lt;ref name=&quot;E1&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Cersei at Winterfell feast.jpg|thumb|183px|Cersei at the feast in Winterfell.]]\n\n[[King Robert]] decides to travel to Winterfell and ask his best friend, Lord [[Eddard Stark]], to become the new Hand, as well as proposing that his son [[Joffrey]] marry Eddard's eldest daughter, [[Sansa]]. Cersei, Jaime, and a retinue of courtiers accompany him. When the royal party arrives at [[Winterfell]] (the seat of [[House Stark]]) [[Eddard Stark|Lord Eddard]] presents his household to Robert and Cersei. After initial greetings, Robert demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to his former betrothed, [[Lyanna Stark]], stoking Cersei's impatience. After Robert and Eddard depart, Cersei sends Jaime to find their younger brother [[Tyrion]], who has become distracted at the local brothel.&lt;ref name=&quot;E1&quot; /&gt;\n\nThat evening a great feast is held and Cersei and [[Catelyn Stark]] exchange cordial words. Cersei seems impressed by Sansa, thinking that she will be a great hit at court. The next morning Eddard and Robert go hunting, leaving the castle largely empty. Cersei and Jaime liaise in derelict tower. [[Bran Stark]] climbs the tower and finds them engaged in sexual intercourse. He is caught watching by Cersei, and Jaime grabs him. He asks how old Bran is. When Bran replies &quot;ten&quot;, Jaime sighs and pushes him out of the window, musing &quot;the things I do for love.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E1&quot; /&gt;\n\nA month later, at breakfast, Tyrion tells his family that Bran is expected to live and notes his sibling's guarded reactions to the news. Cersei visits Catelyn who is sitting vigil for Bran. Cersei tells Catelyn that [[Cersei's black-haired son|her first child]], a beautiful, black-haired boy, died because of a fever. She and Robert were grief-stricken and her prayers and tears were for naught. She offers to pray for Bran's survival, hoping that this time [[Faith of the Seven|the gods]] will listen. The royal party sets out for King's Landing, now joined by Eddard, Sansa and [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. However, a minor fracas between Arya's [[direwolf]] and Joffrey on the [[Kingsroad]] escalates into an argument between Cersei and Eddard. Robert defuses the situation by agreeing that he and Eddard will attend to their own discipline. Cersei insists that the direwolf must be killed. When [[Nymeria]] cannot be found (Arya having driven her off to protect her), Cersei has Sansa's wolf, [[Lady]], killed instead. Eddard, furious, attends to the matter himself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Cersei-joffrey.png|thumb|left|188px|Cersei and her son.]]\n\nArriving back at court, Cersei talks to Joffrey about the incident on the Kingsroad. She tells him that when he is king, the truth will be whatever he decides it will be. Joffrey tells her that he thinks there will be trouble with the Starks, and that when he is king he'll double their taxes, force them to contribute to a standing army and, if they should object, he'd crush them. Cersei elucidates that [[the North]] is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders. She cautions Joffrey that he will need to be cleverer as king. She also advises him to be kind to Sansa to avoid storing up trouble for later, and concludes that &quot;anyone who isn't us is an enemy.&quot; A raven arrives in King's Landing with news of Bran's recovery.

Cersei also tells Robert that at the start of their marriage she truly loved him, even after their first boy died, for quite a while. He says he knows, but could never love her back due to his feelings for [[Lyanna Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Cersei and Robert.jpg|thumb|220px|Cersei and Robert visit Eddard.]]\n\nCersei and King Robert visit Eddard as he recovers from wounds sustained fighting Jaime and his guards.

She does not deny it, instead saying that she and her brother belong together, always. Cersei says she did love Robert, at the start, but on their wedding night he uttered Lyanna's name, which soured their relationship afterwards. Eddard advises her to leave King's Landing before Robert returns from a hunt, as he will then tell Robert the truth. Cersei instead warns him that &quot;In the game of thrones, you win or you die.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E7&quot;&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobert is mortally wounded on the hunt. Cersei is concerned that Eddard will tell Robert the truth, but Eddard chooses to spare his friend further pain. Robert names Eddard Protector of the Realm and regent. Upon Robert's death Cersei quickly installs Joffrey on the throne. Eddard tries to reveal the truth with the help of [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish]], but Baelish betrays him and sides with Cersei.

Sansa agrees, but the plan backfires, as the letter merely encourages Robb to raise an army and march into the [[Riverlands]] to confront the Lannister armies directly. In open court, Cersei encourages Sansa to make a new plea to Joffrey for her father's life. Joffrey agrees to spare him and let him join the [[Night's Watch]], if Eddard recants the claims he has made about Joffrey not being the true king. Sansa is sure he will.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Cersei is present at the Sept of Baelor when Eddard Stark 'confesses' his crimes, as per their arrangement brokered by Sansa and [[Varys]].

The order is carried out by Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], the royal executioner.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWar erupts between the Lannister and Stark armies in the [[Riverlands]] and Cersei attempts to secure her son's hold on the Iron Throne. She takes a new lover, her cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] who was King Robert's squire and gave him the wine that made him too drunk to slay the boar that killed him. She also receives a letter informing her of Jaime's capture by Robb Stark.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nCersei continues to govern from [[King's Landing]] as the Queen Regent to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. She is driven to defend Joffrey's claim in the face of several challengers in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Facing imminent winter she orders the city gates barred to prevent further refugees from entering the city. She is perturbed by the [[File:CerseiS3.jpg|thumb|left|Cersei sits in the small council.]]arrival of her brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] who has been named acting [[Hand of the King]] by their father [[Tywin Lannister]]. She fears that Tyrion schemes to usurp her power and is frustrated when he tells her that since she failed to prevent the death of [[Eddard Stark]] she has been viewed as the disappointing child by Tywin. Tyrion wins her temporary acceptance when he pledges to free [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] from captivity but insists that they need to recover the escaped [[Arya Stark]] to facilitate a prisoner exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;E11&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Stannis Baratheon]] sends copies of a letter detailing Cersei's incestuous relationship with Jaime and the illegitimacy of her children to high lords throughout the seven kingdoms fuelling widespread rumors. Cersei tasks [[Petyr Baelish]] with recovering Arya and is enraged when Baelish dares to reference the rumors. She asks Joffrey to enlist the aid of Tywin in the search but he refuses to involve his grandfather. He provokes an argument with Cersei about the rumors and threatens her life when she slaps him. He then orders a citywide massacre of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s bastard children so that he will have no rival claimants in case his true parentage is revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;E11&quot; /&gt;\n\nCersei rejects King [[Robb Stark]]'s peace terms and refuses a request for aid from the [[Night's Watch]], ignoring news of [[wights]] attacking the [[Lord Commander]].

He warns her to consider the importance of the support of her subjects; she is dismissive of his concerns but becomes upset at the weight of responsibility she has born. Tyrion mocks her relationship with Jaime. She ends the discussion by saying that Tyrion's finest joke was killing their mother when he was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Night Lands&quot; /&gt;\n\nTyrion tests the loyalty of the remaining [[small council]] members by feeding each of them a different marriage plan for [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]].

Cersei confronts Tyrion who insists that the alliance is necessary and that Myrcella will be safer in Dorne. He then has Pycelle arrested for breaking his confidence.

Tyrion learns from Lancel that Cersei is relying on the [[Alchemists' Guild]] to supply [[Wildfire]] to defend the city and subverts her relationship with the [[Alchemists' Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei and the court assemble at the shore of the [[Blackwater Bay]] for the departure of Princess Myrcella. Cersei remains livid about Tyrion's arrangements for her daughter. She threatens to one day deprive him of someone he loves. As they move through the city to return to the [[Red Keep]] they are confronted by angry crowds of starving smallfolk. Joffrey is hit by thrown excrement and triggers a riot by demanding that his guards kill everyone in the crowd. Tyrion marshals the Lannister guards to lead them to safety.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei learns that Sansa has [[Flowering|flowered]] for the first time, she summons Sansa and offers her advice on motherhood. Cersei tells her to love only her children, since love makes you weak, but it is a mother's obligation to love her children. Sansa asks if she should love Joffrey; Cersei replies that she can try.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot; /&gt;[[File:Sansa and Cersei.jpg|thumb|240px|Cersei and Sansa chat following Sansa's first &quot;flowering&quot;.]]\n\nCersei meets with Tyrion to discuss the imminent attack of King's Landing by King [[Stannis Baratheon]]. She admits her struggles controlling Joffrey and openly references her relationship with Jaime. She confides her fear that Joffrey's madness is the price for her sins, including her incestuous relationship. Tyrion tries to comfort her by telling her that Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot; /&gt;\n\nJoffrey is keen to fight in defense of the city. Cersei is furious and suspects Tyrion of trying to kill her son. She mistakenly identifies [[Ros]] as his lover because of the Lannister necklace Tyrion gave her and seizes the opportunity to deliver on the threat she made when Myrcella left. Cersei has the prostitute kidnapped as insurance against Tyrion placing Joffrey in harms way. She reveals her ploy over dinner and Tyrion vows to free Ros and take revenge when Cersei least suspects it.&lt;ref name=&quot;E18&quot; /&gt;\n\nCersei provides refuge for the women of the court in [[Maegor's Holdfast]] during the battle. She prepares for the worst by having Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] present and obtaining deadly [[Essence of Nightshade]] poison from the reinstated Pycelle. She drinks heavily during the siege and torments Sansa Stark when she tries to keep up the morale of the women by praying. She tells Sansa that the gods have no mercy and that Ser Ilyn is there to kill them should the Red Keep be breached.[[File:Cersei and Tommen Blackwater Promo.jpg|thumb|left|Cersei and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] during the [[Battle of Blackwater]].]]Lancel is wounded and returns from the walls to report that Stannis has reached the [[Mud Gate]] despite Tyrion's ingenious use of Wildfire to destroy a portion of his fleet. Cersei sends Lancel to bring Joffrey back to the Red Keep, ignoring his protests that it will damage morale. Joffrey willingly leaves the field but his exit is a blow to the men. Lancel begs Cersei to let him return Joffrey to the front, believing the battle is lost otherwise. Cersei pushes him into a stone pillar, aggravating his injury, and storms out. Convinced the battle is lost, and not wanting her children to die by Stannis's hand, she takes Tommen to the Iron Throne room and prepares to poison him. She is stopped just in time by the unexpected arrival of Tywin, who reports that they have won the battle. Tyrion is betrayed and wounded by Ser [[Mandon Moore]] of the Kingsguard during the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Blackwater]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrion's role in defending the city is not acknowledged and he is left to recover from his wounds, stripped of his power. Rumors circulate that Cersei ordered the attack on Tyrion. No longer considering Tyrion a threat, Cersei releases Ros.&lt;ref name=&quot;E20&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei orchestrates a public ceremony rewarding those who aided the city in the battle. Tywin is officially recognized as Hand of the King, Petyr Baelish is named Lord of Harrenhal for brokering the alliance with House Tyrell and Ser Loras is offered a favor of his choosing. He asks Joffrey to marry his sister, [[Margaery Tyrell]]. Joffrey says that he is constrained by his betrothal to Sansa but Cersei intervenes to insist that the treachery of [[House Stark]] frees him from any obligation. The court welcome the decision with a round of applause.&lt;ref name=&quot;E20&quot; /&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nSome weeks after the Battle of Blackwater,\u00c2\u00a0Cersei pays Tyrion a visit accompanied by two of her son's Kingsguard. She only gains entrance to Tyrion's chambers after agreeing to leave her guards outside. Once inside Cersei demands to know how he will &quot;slander&quot; her to their father now that he is here. Tyrion asks when he has ever slandered her before, and she reminds him of a time at Casterly Rock that he got her in serious trouble with their father: when she was nine years old, Cersei discovered that a servant girl (also nine years old) had stolen a necklace, so she had her guards beat the girl, who ended up losing an eye. Tyrion told their father what Cersei'd done and he was angered, but Cersei notes that the servant girl never stole a necklace again. Tyrion quips that it isn't &quot;slander&quot; if it's true, and he only told Tywin what she really did. The queen admits that Tyrion is a clever man but not as clever as he might believe. Tyrion merely retorts that this still makes him a great deal more clever that her. Cersei then leaves abruptly and just in time to prevent Meryn Trant and Bronn from exchanging blows.\n\nAt night Cersei and Joffrey are hosting a private dinner party for Loras and Margaery Tyrell. Cersei is surprised that Margaery has been handing out food aid to the [[smallfolk]] of the city and visiting orphanages. Unlike Cersei, who only knows how to rule through fear, Margaery is skilled at manipulating the people into loving her, and this concerns Cersei. After trading veiled insults with both her son and future daughter-in-law it becomes clear that Cersei doesn't trust Margaery and fears that the younger woman has come to supplant her as queen.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Margaery and Cersei Second Sons.jpg|thumb|240px|Cersei threatens to kill [[Margaery Tyrell]] in her sleep.]]\n\nAs the court gathers for Tyrion's wedding, Cersei finally snaps when Margaery says she looks radiant. Cersei reminds the queen-in-waiting of the lyrics of ''[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains of Castamere]]'' and to take a lesson of what happened to House Reyne. Cersei threatens to have Margaery strangled in her sleep if she ever refers to her as &quot;sister&quot; again. Cersei maintains a cool expression during the ceremony, and does not laugh when Joffrey ridicules Tyrion by removing his footstool. During the wedding feast, Joffrey heads off to torment Sansa some more. Fed up with him, Cersei tells him to speak with Margaery instead, but he ignores her. Cersei later retreats to an upper gallery and stares despondently out over [[Blackwater Bay]]. Loras sees her and tries to make small talk, but Cersei rudely brushes him off.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei is present at the meeting where Tyrion learns of [[Red wedding|Robb and Catelyn's deaths]]. Joffrey comments that he wants Robb's head to present to Sansa at his wedding feast, though Varys reminds him that Sansa is now his aunt-by-marriage. Cersei\u00c2\u00a0brushes this off as a joke, though Joffrey\u00c2\u00a0denies this. She also reassures Joffrey when he is threatned by Tyrion. She also leads Joffrey\u00c2\u00a0to bed after he calls Tywin a coward.&lt;ref name=&quot;E29&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater, Cersei\u00c2\u00a0visits Tyrion and rudely dismisses Podrick. She tells\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0that he should give\u00c2\u00a0Sansa a son if he truly wants to make her happy, though Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0responds by asking her if she is happy as she has children. Cersei admits that she is not happy, but would've thrown herself &quot;from the highest window in the [[Red Keep]]&quot; without them, even Joffrey. She recounts of how he was all she had before Myrcella was born and how she would spend hours looking at him, and acknowledges that he is one of the &quot;terrible ones&quot;. Tyrion asks her when [[War of the Five Kings|this]] will end, and Cersei replies when they have dealt with all their enemies. Tyrion mentions how dealing with one enemy creates two more, and she just says that they will be in this position for a long time.&lt;ref name=&quot;E29&quot; /&gt;\n\nWhen\u00c2\u00a0Jaime returns to King's Landing, he immediately goes to Cersei's chambers and calls her name. She turns around, shocked and sickened at finding him maimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;E29&quot; /&gt;\n\n===\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;[[Season 4]]===\nCersei is present while [[Qyburn]] is attaching\u00c2\u00a0Jaime's golden hand that she commissioned for him because she's so disgusted by his stump. After Qyburn departs from Cersei's\u00c2\u00a0chambers, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] asks why she drinks more than she used to. Cersei replies that she drinks more because Jaime left the capital, [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] was killed, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] was shipped off to Dorne, they went through a siege, and her son [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is being married to [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] whom she despises. When Jaime tries to make love to her, she refuses him and says that everything\u00c2\u00a0has changed and that he took too long reaching King's Landing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei\u00c2\u00a0is present at the breakfast of Joffrey and Margaery and tells [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]\u00c2\u00a0about [[Shae]] being seen leaving Tyrion's chambers. During the [[Purple Wedding|Royal Wedding]], Cersei\u00c2\u00a0sits with the rest of the royal family. When [[Brienne of Tarth]]\u00c2\u00a0approaches the king and Margaery, she bows and congratulates them on their marriage. Cersei\u00c2\u00a0quickly points out that she bowed instead of performing a curtsey. She then thanks Brienne\u00c2\u00a0for bringing her brother back and asks her if she loves Jaime, Brienne responds by walking off.&lt;ref name=&quot;E32&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:110312-Cersei-Lannister-season-4-meme-0e4U.jpeg|thumb|left|Cersei reacts to Joffrey's death.]]\n\nAfter Margaery says that the leftovers were going to the poor, Cersei kisses her on the cheek and says she is an inspiration to them all. Shortly after that she goes over to [[Pycelle]] , who is talking to a young woman, Cersei tells Pycelle to leave her alone and says that she should get Qyburn\u00c2\u00a0to examine her. Pycelle\u00c2\u00a0mocks Qyburn but Cersei responds by ordering Pycelle\u00c2\u00a0to go to the kitchens and order the cooks to give the leftovers to the dogs. Pycelle is reluctant to do so, but Cersei\u00c2\u00a0threatens to have him killed if he does not. Cersei and Tywin meet [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn]] and [[Ellaria Sand|Ellaria]] and the four get into a heated discussion. When Joffrey is dying, Cersei rushes over to her son and is in tears when he dies. In a blind rage, she has [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;E32&quot; /&gt;\n\nCersei is mourning Joffrey while Tywin arrives and immediately begins instructing Tommen on the qualities of a good king. After the two leave, Jaime arrives to comfort Cersei. She breaks down into tears and asks Jaime to avenge their son by killing Tyrion. Jaime is not convinced that Tyrion was behind the murder and tells Cersei that there will be a trial, but she does not care. He tries to comfort her through his affections. Cersei refuses initially, but Jaime is aggressive. Cersei insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex, and asks Jaime to stop, saying &quot;It isn't right, it isn't [[File:Jaime and Cersei - Breaker of Chains.png|thumb|202px|Jaime tempts Cersei within the Great Sept of Baelor.]]right...&quot; and Jaime refuses to stop, saying, &quot;I don't care, I don't care...&quot;. They then have sex next to their dead son's corpse.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei calls Jaime to his chambers, but only to know about Kingsguard formations for protecting Tommen. She then asks why Catelyn Stark released him from his captivity. Jaime replies that he swore by all the gods that he would bring back Catelyn Stark's daughters to her. Cersei questions his loyalty to their enemies, but Jaime states that he only did it so he could return to her. She then asks if he could track down and kill Sansa Stark, believing that she schemed with Tyrion to murder Joffrey. Jaime remains silent. He then tries to convince Cersei that Tyrion is innocent, but she refutes that he has always pitied their little brother and firmly believes that Tyrion is the monster that killed their son. After, Cersei asks him to leave, but refers to him as &quot;Lord Commander&quot;, showing that their relationship has almost completely deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei\u00c2\u00a0is present at the coronation of her son, Tommen. Seeing Margaery at the coronation, Cersei\u00c2\u00a0tells her that she understands that Joffrey was a monster, but as her first child, Cersei\u00c2\u00a0still loved him. She also believes the newly crowned\u00c2\u00a0Tommen\u00c2\u00a0will make a good and decent king, but he needs guidance. Cersei asks [[File:CerseiTrialTyrion.png|thumb|left|Cersei testifies against Tyrion during his court trial.]]Margaery\u00c2\u00a0if she is still interested in being queen. Margaery says she will need to speak to her father about the matter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei is present at a small council that discusses the threat of [[Daenerys Targaryen]], who they learn has recently conquered Meereen. Cersei\u00c2\u00a0doubts that Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0is a credible threat to the Iron Throne, a view not shared by the rest of the council. When Varys\u00c2\u00a0mentions that Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, Cersei recounts him as being both a coward and a traitor to the crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Laws of Gods and Men&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Game-of-thrones-season-4-vengeance-trailer-cersei-lannister.jpg|thumb|202px|Cersei presides over Tyrion's trial by combat.]]\n\nAt Tyrion's trial, Cersei is verbally confronted by Tyrion, who angrily declares his innocence, but tells her how he wishes he could have been the one to murder Joffrey and that he felt the boy deserved it.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Laws of Gods and Men&quot; /&gt; Cersei approaches [[Gregor Clegane]] and enlists him as her champion in the trial by combat for Tyrion's fate.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mockingbird]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She watches proudly as he defeats Tyrion's champion, [[Oberyn Martell]], and smiles as their father sentences Tyrion to death.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She later sees to the treatment of Ser Gregor's wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Children&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Children]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei confronts her father and defiantly asserts once again that she will not consent to marry [[Loras Tyrell]]. When Tywin insists, she shocks him further by confirming for the first time to his face that the rumors about her relationship with her twin brother are in fact true. Disgusted, she leaves Tywin's quarters and proceeds to find Jaime. Though they still disagree on the fate of their younger brother, she approaches Jaime and kisses him passionately. She reaffirms her love for him and her wishes to continue their relationship regardless of what others may say. She kisses his gold hand as a symbol of her acceptance, and he makes love to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Children&quot; /&gt;\n\n===[[Season 5]]===\n''TBA''\n\n", "Personality": "Cersei is willful, cold, ambitious, and cunning in the sense that she is utterly willing to betray anyone who trusts her, or do anything to protect her own. However, she is also arrogant and self-centered to a fault. While she certainly believes herself to be a master strategist, she is extremely impatient, short-sighted, and prone to displays of poor judgment, resulting in her being unskilled at manipulating enemies who openly distrust her. Cersei's own father Tywin stated to her that he distrusts her because she isn't nearly as intelligent as she believes herself to be.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This makes for a dangerous combination, as not only is Cersei unintelligent, but she does not even realize her own limitations.\n\nA mistake outsiders often make when dealing with Cersei is assuming that she has the emotional maturity and wisdom of a queen, or at least an adult, when her real personality is closer to a petulant child inhabiting an adult's body. In public, Cersei often tries to exude a sense of calm and regal control over her surroundings. When things do not go her own way, however, Cersei's usual response is to become extremely flippant, even when the assembled Small Council is trying to give her advice which would genuinely serve her own interests. Cersei's behavior is very mercurial, capable of switching between seemingly true affection for someone to extreme loathing over trifles.\n\nAs Tyrion noted, Cersei often uses her honest feelings to dishonestly manipulate other people. For example, her fear for the safety of her children is actually genuine, but she will shamelessly use this to play on the sympathy of other people, to sway them into supporting her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mockingbird]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei despises the restraints placed on her because she is a woman and is jealous of the freedoms that men have in her society. Several of the noble Houses in the Seven Kingdoms have more liberal attitudes when it comes to involving female members of their family in politics. The women of [[House Tyrell]], for example, are expected to be involved in politics and have thus been trained from a young age in the skills of ruling. Unfortunately, Cersei's father Tywin is a staunch conservative, and never envisioned Cersei playing an active role in politics. Instead, her duty was to cement a marriage alliance and raise royal children, nothing more. The practical result is that, right or wrong, Tywin didn't raise Cersei to be skilled in ruling or in political intrigue. While confronted with these shortfalls, Cersei often blames her father or society in general for not giving her the years of training needed to rule, but complaining about it doesn't change the fact that she simply doesn't possess these skills. Cersei hates being a woman in Westerosi society, and scorns other women in general for what she perceives as their weakness: Cersei isn't so much angry at men for mistreating women, as angry that she wasn't born a man.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Blackwater]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei's lack of a parental relationship growing up is reflected in how poorly she has served as a mother to her own children. While she certainly dotes on them and genuinely loves them, she does not possess much in the way of wisdom or advice. She is unable to act as a stable moral instructor to them. She considers herself to be obsessed with the welfare of all of her children.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot; /&gt; However, she has showered so much attention on Joffrey throughout his life that hypocritically, she really doesn't know her other children very well - just as her own father Tywin focused all of his attention on Jaime, while ignoring Cersei and Tyrion.\n\n"}, "title": "Cersei Lannister"}
