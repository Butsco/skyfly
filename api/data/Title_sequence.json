{"attributes": {"class": "&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:80%;&quot;"}, "sections": {"Conception": "The title sequence was created by a company named Elastic, which had previously created the title sequences for ''[[wikipedia:Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Big Love|Big Love]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Carnivale|Carnivale]]'' for [[HBO]]. The latter won them an Emmy Award.\n\nThe title sequence was inspired by the maps of Westeros that precede each novel in the series (and maps in fantasy novels in general). The creators decided to place the map on the inner surface of a sphere with an astrolabe-sun object at the center. The camera would then visit different parts of the map, while illustrations on the astrolabe covered some of the backstory to the series. The turning gears and cogs were meant to be reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's inventions.\n\n", "Description": "[[Image:Doom of Valyria Title Sequence.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Relief detail showing the Doom of Valyria.]]\n[[Image:Robert's_Rebellion_Title_Sequence.png|thumb|right|200px|Relief detail showing Robert's Rebellion.]]\n[[Image:Baratheon Victory Title Sequence.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Relief detail depicting Robert Baratheon's victory.]]\n[[Image:Game of Thrones title card.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Game of Thrones'' title card.]]\nThe title sequence consists of a three-dimensional map of the world, with the continents of [[Westeros]] and [[Essos]] located on the inner surface of a sphere. At the center of the sphere is a light source, effectively a sun surrounded by an astrolabe-like arrangement of rotating rings. The details of the title sequence change each week depending on the locations visited. The following description is how the sequence appears in the first episode of the series, &quot;[[Winter is Coming]]&quot;.\n\nThe sequence opens with a close-up of the sun and the astrolabe surrounding it. Relief details are visible on the astrolabe, showing a volcano destroying a city while a [[dragon]] watches on and several people escaping in a boat, a reference to the [[Doom of Valyria]]. The camera then pans to a wide-shot of Westeros and Essos before zooming in on the city of [[King's Landing]], in particular the sigil of [[House Baratheon]] on what appears to be a large gear in the middle of the city. The gear begins turning, moving other cogs, and then three-dimensional buildings start rising out of the ground, such as the [[Red Keep]] and the [[Great Sept of Baelor]].\n\nOnce the city is assembled, the camera moves north across Westeros to [[Winterfell]], which similarly rises out of the ground while a gear bearing the sigil of [[House Stark]] rotates. The camera pays particular attention to the [[godswood]] of Winterfell and its heart tree as it rises out of the ground before panning up to the sun and astrolabe. There is then another close-up of the detail on the astrolabe, this time showing the Stark [[direwolf]], [[Lannister]] lion and Baratheon stag engaging the [[Targaryen]] [[dragon]] in combat, a reference to [[Robert's Rebellion]].\n\nThe camera returns to Winterfell and then pans north to [[the Wall]], where more gears start turning and [[Castle Black]] emerges from the ground, while the pulley lift emerges from the face of the Wall. The camera pulls all the way back to King's Landing before moving across the [[Narrow Sea]]\u00c2\u00a0to the [[Free City]] of [[Pentos]], which similarly emerges from the ground while gears rotate.\n\nThe title sequence ends with a return to the relief detail of the astrolabe, now showing the animals representing the various [[noble house]]s of Westeros bowing to the triumphant Baratheon stag. The ''Game of Thrones'' logo then appears over the astrolabe, with the heads of a dragon, wolf, lion, and stag emerging from the side of the logo.\n\n", "Homage": "''[[wikipedia:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]]'' episode ''&quot;Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart&quot;'' features a homage to the ''Game of Thrones'' title sequence, with famous buildings in the town of Springfield rising through the ground as characters watch on, dressed in ''Game of Thrones''-style costumes. The Wall is replaced by the monolithic &quot;Couch&quot; at the end of the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5890410/watch-the-simpsons-game-of-thrones-intro io9]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "TOP": "Title sequence02821mvq8tzchvvnbel8hm02rkd3fx3za33r1785512015-03-22T15:19:47ZThe White Winged Fury26111788[[File:Game Of Thrones|thumb|250px|right|The title sequence for ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.]]\nThe ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' title sequence introduces every episode and changes depending on the locations visited in that particular episode.\n\n", "Variations": "===First Season===\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:80%;&quot;\n|- style=&quot;vertical-align:bottom;&quot;\n!
