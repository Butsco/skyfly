The slave lords grew rich and fat as pyramids were raised around them, pleasure houses were filled, and fighting pits were opened.|Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]|Old Ghis &amp; Slaver's Bay}}\n\n'''Fighting pits''' are establishments, usually huge arenas, where men and women, usually [[Slavery|slaves]], fight to the death against other pit fighters or wild animals for the entertainment of patrons.\n\nThe cities of [[Slaver's Bay]] are known for their fighting pits.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are several fighting pits in Slaver's Bay. The combatants wear no armor in the fighting pits as it is blood the crowds have come to see. Usually, fighting pits feature gladiators against gladiators, gladiators against beasts, or beast against beasts. But there are also pits in which slave children are forced to fight beasts, and &quot;follies&quot; in which children, cripples, dwarfs or old people are placed with mock weapons against wild animals for the mockery of onlookers. There are even pits in which slave children are covered in different foods so that patrons may bet on which child a given beast will devour first.\n\n"}, "title": "Fighting pit"}
