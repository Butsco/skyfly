Suddenly, Rennick acts as if he hears something and is concerned. Lannister guardsman follows him hesitantly. When Rennick draws his sword, he thinks they are about to be attacked, but then Rennick passes gas and starts laughing. Rennick starts urinating on the ground and continues to laugh at his joke ignoring the continued restlessness of the horses. The Lannister guardsman realizes something is out there and screams Rennick's name. Rennick looks up just as [[Grey Wind]], Robb Stark's direwolf leaps out of the trees. Robb Stark has sent Grey Wind to attack the horses to cause confusion when the Stark army attacks the camp.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Lannister guardsman (Garden of Bones)"}
