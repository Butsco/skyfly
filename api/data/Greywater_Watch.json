It is ruled by [[House Reed]], a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. Greywater Watch is nigh-untraceable because it moves.\n\nIt is the home of [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] and [[Meera Reed]] and their father, Lord [[Howland Reed]]. It is the southernmost stronghold in [[the North]], and as such its rulers have a longstanding enmity with [[House Frey]] , who rule the area of the [[Riverlands]]\u00c2\u00a0on the southern side of the Neck.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Greywater Watch is the seat of House Reed, one of the most loyal vassals of the Starks. No raven can reach Greywater Watch because it is said to be constantly moving.\n\nGreywater Watch has not been mentioned in the series yet except for a map that mistakenly refers to the settlement as 'Greytower Watch.'\n\n"}, "title": "Greywater Watch"}
