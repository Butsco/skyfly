He graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 2010 with a string of theatrical credits to his name. ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' marks his first television appearance.\n\nIn ''Game of Thrones'' he plays the role of [[Grenn]]. He was announced in the role on 1 August 2010. He initially appeared as a guest star in the [[Season 1|first season]] and returned in this role for the [[Season 2|second]], [[Season 3|third season]] and [[Season 4|fourth season]].\n\nBecause different actors often have vastly different filming schedules, Mark Stanley has frequently filled in for other roles during cast table-reads of the script at the production team's home office in Belfast. He has table-read [[Jon Snow]]'s lines opposite Rose Leslie ([[Ygritte]]), and writer [[Bryan Cogman]] said that Stanley also performed a terrific [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Season_3_Interview_Bryan_Cogman Westeros.org], Season 3 Interview: Bryan Cogman.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nGrenn and Pypar actually don't die at the [[Battle of Castle Black]] in the novels, and in Season 4 both were still alive as of the fifth and most current book.  Many other minor Night's Watch characters also die during the battle in the books.  The TV writers explained that they wanted to show the real cost of the battle and for it to have dramatic impact, which meant they had to kill a few named recurring characters (instead of nameless background extras, which would carry no dramatic weight).  Stanley explained that he had no prior warning of this, and first found out that his character was killed off ''as he was reading the script'' for the episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/new-blu-ray-video-extra-game-of-thrones-fallen-roundtable/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery widths=&quot;160&quot; spacing=&quot;small&quot; captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nBehind-the-Scenes-game-of-thrones Mark and JOhn.jpg|Behind the scenes with [[John Bradley-West]].\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 4440305}}\n* [http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100805/local/sinbad-to-be-shot-here-for-sky1 Mark Stanley's Guildhall profile.]\n\n"}, "title": "Mark Stanley"}
