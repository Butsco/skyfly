Established on [[Lhazar]], southeast of [[Vaes Dothrak]], their camps are frequently raided for slaves by the [[Dothraki]], who refer to them as '''Lamb Men'''.\n\n[[File:Mirri Maz Duur.jpg|thumb|[[Mirri Maz Duur]], a Lhazareen healer and &quot;maegi&quot;]]\n\nMirroring the importance of shepherding in Lhazareen culture, their deity is known as the &quot;[[Great Shepherd]]&quot;.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Lhazareen have copper skin, dark hair, and almond-shaped eyes, similar to the Dothraki, but they are more squat in stature and flat-faced.\n\nLhazar was never part of the [[Valyrian Freehold]], so unlike the Free Cities and even nearby [[Slaver's Bay]] which had been conquered by Valyria, the Lhazareen language is not derived from Valyrian. There are no examples of the Lhazareen language in the books beyond person and place names, but it is described as having a singsong quality.\n\nThe Dothraki believe the Lhazareen engage in sexual acts with their sheep, though outsiders also think the Dothraki engage in sexual acts with their horses.\n\n"}, "title": "Lhazareen"}
