The garrison of Dragonstone was ready to sell Viserys and Daenerys to\u00c2\u00a0Stannis, but before they could go ahead Ser Willem Darry, along with four other loyalists, smuggled Viserys and Daenerys along with a wet nurse to the [[Braavosian Coastlands]], were they would live in exile.\n\nThe fall of the castle wasn't really considered a battle, as with the war clearly lost most of the garrison wanted to simply surrender - to the point that they would have given up the royal children still in their possession. The four remaining loyalist knights fled with the children before Stannis arrived, so no one put up a significant fight.\n\nAs Brynden Tully pointed out the House Tully [[House Tully (Histories &amp; Lore)|Histories &amp;amp; Lore]] featurette, the rebel side in the war had no strength at sea - in part because years before, Brynden had not entered into a marriage-alliance with [[House Redwyne]], who possess a [[Redwyne Fleet|large fleet]]. After the Sack of King's Landing, it still took the victorious rebels some time to find enough ships to transport an attack force to Dragonstone, giving the royal children enough time to escape to the Free Cities.\n\n", "History": "===Prelude===\nFollowing the [[Sack of King's Landing]] and the death of the [[Mad King]], [[Robert Baratheon]] took the [[Iron Throne]] and was crowned Robert of the [[House Baratheon]], First of His Name, [[King of the Andals and the First Men]], [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms]] and [[Protector of the Realm]]. However, the war was not over.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Sack of King's Landing (Complete Guide to Westeros)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Lord [[Mace Tyrell]] bent the knee and his siege of [[Storm's End]] was lifted,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Robert's Rebellion (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robert sent his brother [[Stannis]] to [[Dragonstone (castle)|Dragonstone]], the island fortress located at the [[Dragonstone (island)|eponymous island]], where Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]] and Prince [[Viserys]] had been sent following the rebel victory at the [[Battle of the Trident]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Sack of King's Landing (Complete Guide to Westeros)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Events===\n[[File:Smuggled.jpg|thumb|Ser Willem Darry smuggles Viserys and Daenerys across the Narrow Sea.]]\nStannis led the [[Royal fleet]] aboard the ''[[Fury]]'' to capture Prince Viserys and Princess [[Daenerys]], who had been recently born. However, before he arrived, Ser [[Willem Darry]], one of the last Targaryen loyalists, smuggled the two children across the Narrow Sea.  The remaining garrison simply surrendered when Stannis arrived.\n\n===Aftermath===\nEnraged over the escape of Viserys and Daenerys and blaming Stannis for it, Robert stripped Storm's End from him and granted it to their younger brother [[Renly]]. Instead, Robert granted Dragonstone to Stannis. Stannis took it as a slight, despite Dragonstone had been the traditional seat of the heir to the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n"}, "title": "Assault on Dragonstone"}
