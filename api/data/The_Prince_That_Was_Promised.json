He was a legendary warrior who rose up and defeated the Others - the books' name for the [[White Walkers]] - during the [[Long Night]]. He wielded a sword of fire, called Lightbringer. There is some debate amongst fans as to the interchangeability of &quot;Azor Ahai&quot; and &quot;The Prince That Was Promised&quot;. It seems that Azor Ahai is the name given to the legendary figure, while the Prince That Was Promised is more properly his reincarnation. However, the books do not in fact make explicit the connection between the ''stories'' of Azor Ahai and the ''prophecies'' of the Prince That Was Promised.\n", "TOP": "The Prince That Was Promised08429sfj9525jl0pfvmwmigx7x6t7lwh9pjy1764662015-03-12T21:46:19ZThe Dragon Demands5014364You can't &quot;mention&quot; a prophecy....Undo revision 176461 by [[Special:Contributions/Titanchamp7|Titanchamp7]] ([[User talk:Titanchamp7|talk]])[[File:StannisNorthRemember.jpg|right|300px|thumb|According to [[Melisandre]], Stannis Baratheon is the prophesied Prince That Was Promised, the Warrior of Light.]]\n\n{{Quote|You will betray the men serving you, you will betray your family, you will betray everything you once held dear... and it will all be worth it, because you are the Son of Fire, you are the Warrior of Light.|Melisandre to Stannis Baratheon|Valar Morghulis}}\n'''&quot;The Prince That Was Promised&quot;''',&lt;ref&gt;Game of Thrones Season 2 featurette: Religions of Westeros&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Son of Fire''' and '''Warrior of Light''',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; is a mythic figure in the religion of the [[Lord of Light]].
