It is the seat of [[House Connington]]. The castle is located south-west of Storm's End on the western edge of [[Shipbreaker Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/storms-end/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Storm's End entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Griffin's Roost is the seat of House Connington.\n\nPrior to [[Robert's Rebellion]], the young Lord Jon Connington was one of Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]'s closest friends and allies. During the rebellion, the [[Mad King]] promoted Connington to the rank of [[Hand of the King]] and tasked him with destroying [[Robert Baratheon]]'s rebel army before it could join with the forces being gathered by Houses [[Stark]], [[Arryn]] and [[Tully]] in the [[Riverlands]].\n\nFollowing Robert's defeat at the Battle of Ashford, Connington's forces pursued Robert north to [[Stoney Sept]], trapping him in the town. Connington refused to raze the town, instead conducting a house-to-house search while Robert was hidden by rebel sympathizers. Connington was still searching when [[Eddard Stark]] arrived with a rescue force. In the resulting [[Battle of the Bells]], Connington was defeated and his army repulsed from the town with heavy losses.\n\nKing Aerys was furious with Connington's failure. He was stripped of lands and titles and sent into exile in the [[Free Cities]], where it is rumored that he drank himself to death after a brief stint with the [[Golden Company]]. After taking the Iron Throne, King Robert granted Griffin's Roost to Jon's cousin Ronnet, who had joined the rebellion after Jon's exile. However, most of the Connington lands were distributed among more fervent supporters of the rebellion. The lordship wasn't restored either so House Connington was reduced to the status of knightly house.\n\n"}, "title": "Griffin's Roost"}
