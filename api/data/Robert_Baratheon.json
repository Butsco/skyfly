I'm trying to get you to run my [[Seven Kingdoms|kingdom]] while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave.|Robert Baratheon to [[Eddard Stark]]|Winter is Coming}}\n\n'''Robert Baratheon''' is a major character in the [[Season 1|first season]]. He is played by starring cast member [[Mark Addy]], and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming|series premiere]].\n\nRobert Baratheon was the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, formally styled as '''Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name, [[King of the Andals and the First Men]], [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms]] and [[Protector of the Realm]]'''. He took the throne through conquest in the war known as [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Robert was a great warrior in his youth. He killed [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], Prince of Dragonstone, at the [[Battle of the Trident]]. After the war, Robert married [[Cersei Lannister]] to cement an alliance with [[House Lannister]] to hold the kingdoms together, but the marriage is loveless. Robert and Cersei have three children: [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Unbeknown to Robert, all three were actually fathered by Cersei's twin brother, [[Jaime Lannister]].\n\nRobert found the winning of his kingdom far more fulfilling than the running of it, and spent much of the next seventeen years whoring, drinking and hunting. So it is his [[small council]] that is delegated the tedious tasks of ruling. He is a childhood friend of [[Eddard Stark]] and considers him his true brother. He names Ned [[Hand of the King]] when the [[Jon Arryn|previous Hand]] dies in mysterious circumstances. Eddard launches an investigation and discovers that his predecessor was scrutinising the parentage of Cersei's children. Fearful of exposure, Cersei instructs Robert's squire, [[Lancel Lannister]], to give him too much wine while hunting. Robert is fatally wounded by a boar and succumbs to his injuries soon afterwards. Robert names Eddard protector of the realm just before his death. Cersei\u00c2\u00a0then ignores the proclamation, has Eddard arrested, and seizes the throne for her son, [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. This dispute leads to the [[War of the Five Kings]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]] ''novels, Robert is in his mid-thirties when the events of the books begin. He is jovial and fun-loving, fond of battle, women and drink. As a young man Robert was a formidable warrior, noted for his chivalry, sense of honor and immense charisma. He won several loyal Targaryen bannermen to his cause through strength of personality alone. Very tall and incredibly muscular, Robert was considered one of the most attractive men in Westeros, desired by every maiden in the realm. However, after becoming king, Robert let himself go somewhat, becoming fat, soft and indolent, though still capable of great generosity to his friends. Robert has also become more bitter following Lyanna's death and his unhappy marriage to Cersei, despite their multiple children.\n\n===Bastards===\n\nRobert is rumored to have fathered over a dozen [[Bastards|bastard]] children over the years, though exactly how many he has is unknown even to Robert. Cersei once visited a [[Maggy|maegi]] in her youth who predicted that Cersei would have three children (Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen) and that Robert would have sixteen - the prophecy about Cersei's children turned out to be true, but it is unknown if the prophecy about Robert's children turned out to be accurate. Robert had a voracious sexual appetite since he was a teenager, however, and he had sex with innumerable whores and servant girls for over twenty years before his death, so tracking down all of his bastards would be an exceedingly difficult task. [[Varys]] himself can confirm of at least eight bastard children which Robert fathered over the years.\n\n*Robert's only acknowledged bastard is Edric Storm, whom he acknowledged because his mother was not a commoner but a noblewoman from [[House Florent]]- Delena Florent, Selyses' cousin. Robert acknowledged the boy but Cersei would have been furious if he raised him in his own home, so he sent Edric away to be fostered at [[Storm's End]] his whole life. Edric had virtually no contact with Robert: Edric would receive [[nameday]] presents every year (a pony one year, a sable cloak the next, and once even a miniature warhammer similar to the one Robert used) and write thank-you letters to Robert for them, but they were actually sent by Varys without Robert's input at all. When reading those letters, Robert would laugh and ask Varys what he sent that year. Edric bears amazing resemblance to his father; when [[Davos Seaworth]] first met Edric, he immediately concluded the youth is a bastard of Robert. Stannis resents Edric because the youth's presence is a constant reminder to him how Robert violated his wedding bed (similarly to [[Catelyn Stark]]'s feelings toward [[Jon Snow]]), but allows him to spend time with [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]]. Although [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse]] and [[Melisandre]] urged Stannis to sacrifice Edric (in the TV series he was switched with Gendry), Stannis was not thrilled about killing his nephew, and was not overly furious when it was revealed that Davos sent him away.\n\n*Another confirmed bastard is Mya Stone, the eldest of Robert's bastards. She is nineteen years old. Robert fathered her in the Vale while he was fostering there with Eddard Stark, a few years before he led the rebellion against King Aerys Targaryen (thus she is apparently the oldest of his bastards, in her late teens/early twenties). Mya was not ''officially'' acknowledged by Robert, but her existence is considered to be an open secret. Robert knew her when she was a toddler but he left her behind when he became king; once during a heated argument over Robert's disappointment regarding Joffrey, Robert threatened to punish Cersei by bringing a bastard daughter of his to be raised in the Red Keep (the name of the girl in question is not mentioned, but it's likely to be Mya), and Cersei responded &quot;Do as you please, but you may find that the city is not a healthy place for a growing girl&quot; - bluntly implying that she would harm the girl; Robert angrily punched Cersei, but knowing that she truly meant this threat, he backed down. Thus while Mya has not been officially, legally acknowledged as Robert's bastard, her status as his daughter is such public knowledge that she uses the special bastard surname &quot;Stone&quot; - without complaint by others that Robert technically never officially gave her the right to use the name &quot;Stone&quot;. Mya works as a pack mule guide along the treacherous mountain path leading to [[the Eyrie]], and is encountered by [[Catelyn Stark]] when she brings [[Tyrion Lannister]] to the Eyrie to hold prisoner at her sister [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]]'s court.\n\n*In the books, [[Barra]] was the only of Robert's bastards who was reported to be killed at Cersei's command following his death. She was explicitly killed on Cersei's orders, not on Joffrey's as in the TV series.\n\n*Petyr Baelish also told Eddard Stark that some years earlier Robert fathered bastard twins with a serving woman at Casterly Rock, and that Cersei had both children killed. Ned was surprised that Robert would have stood by and let such a thing happen, but then recalled that Robert seemed to have grown adept at shutting his eyes. It is unknown if the story is true.\n\nRobert never cared much about his bastards. According to Stannis, he liked the making of children well enough, but after birth they were a bother to him.\n\nGendry, Edric Storm, Mya Stone, plus the deceased Barra and twins at Casterly Rock only account for six bastards, however, when Varys said he knew of at least eight. When [[Arya Stark]] and Gendry first encounter the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] in the Riverlands, they pass through the town of [[Stoney Sept]], where they encounter a dark-haired prostitute named Bella who ''claims'' to be a bastard of Robert. Bella states that she is the daughter of a prostitute that Robert had sex with as he was passing through the town during the [[Battle of the Bells]], and that she was named &quot;Bella&quot; for the battle. She does generally resemble Robert and her age matches her story of when Robert would have had sex with her mother, but her claim cannot be definitely confirmed.\n\nThe TV series has not introduced any other bastards besides Gendry, even going so far as to combine parts of Edric Storm's storyline - being taken to Dragonstone - with Gendry's storyline in Season 3. It is unclear if the TV series means to imply that Gendry is Robert's only surviving bastard, but either way the focus given to Gendry is much greater in the TV continuity.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|Honor?

King Robert also loves to throw events such as [[tournament]]s at which he spares no expense.

After initial greetings, Robert demands to see the crypts and pay his respects, stoking Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s impatience. In the crypts Robert offers prayers to a statue of [[Lyanna Stark]]. He tells Eddard that in his dreams he kills [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] every night anew, but Eddard replies that [[House Targaryen]] is destroyed. &quot;Not all of them,&quot; Robert counters. Robert formally offers Eddard the role of [[Hand of the King]], telling him that he needs someone to run the kingdom and revealing that he is fearful of betrayal from within his court. Eddard asks for time to think about it. Robert agrees but offers a sweetener: the hand of his son [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] in marriage to Eddard's daughter [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. A great feast is held in honor of the king's visit to Winterfell. The next morning Eddard and Robert go hunting and Eddard accepts Robert's offer, with Robert stating that Ned is a loyal friend, the last one he's got.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe parties depart Winterfell. Days later, on the Kingsroad south to the capital, Robert calls a halt to discuss some newly-arrived dire news with Eddard. Robert's spies have learned of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s marriage to [[Drogo|Khal Drogo]] whose ''[[khalasar]]'' is reported to number over one hundred thousand people. Eddard points out that the [[Dothraki]] cannot cross the [[Narrow Sea]], as they have no ships, but Robert is concerned that the [[Seven Kingdoms]] will soon face another war.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn the Kingsroad, the royal party reaches the [[Crossroads Inn]], a noted stop on the way south to the capital. Joffrey is injured by [[Nymeria]], a direwolf belonging to Ned's younger daughter [[Arya Stark|Arya]] during the halt. Arya is brought before Robert and truthfully blames Joffrey for instigating the incident but Joffrey's falsified version of events is supported by Sansa. Robert is furious that a minor fracas has become a major incident with his wife and his new Hand accusing one another's children; he also appears to exhibit disdain towards Joffrey over the fact his son was beaten and disarmed by a girl several years his junior. He decides to let Ned discipline\u00c2\u00a0Arya whilst he will do the same to Joffrey, but to appease his Queen he agrees that a direwolf must be executed. When Nymeria cannot be found, Robert commands that Sansa's wolf [[Lady]] must be killed instead.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Kingsroad&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn his return to King's Landing Robert orders a [[tournament]] to celebrate Eddard's appointment as King's Hand. He avoids the [[small council]] meetings where discussion of the kingdom's mounting debts and the difficulty of paying for the tournament are raised. Robert swaps old war stories with [[Barristan Selmy|Ser Barristan Selmy]], a distinguished and famous knight and [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Kingsguard]] and [[Jaime Lannister]], whilst also humiliating his 'useless' squire, [[Lancel Lannister]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robert enjoys the attentions of at least four women in his chambers. Jaime Lannister, left guarding his room outside, is infuriated by the insult done to his sister by this, and vents about it to [[Jory Cassel]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobert learns that Daenerys is pregnant and orders that she and her brother [[Viserys Targaryen]] be assassinated. Eddard disagrees with the decision, and resigns as Hand, enraging Robert. Later, Cersei asks the King if it was wise to lose Eddard in this way and they discuss their marriage. Robert tells her he could never love her due to his feelings for Lyanna. Robert's brother [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] reports that Robert is planning a big hunt and has asked Renly to accompany him, a prospect Renly dreads.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Robert's hunting party.jpg|thumb|King Robert Baratheon, [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], the King's squire [[Lancel Lannister]], and [[Barristan Selmy]] at the hunt.]]\n\nRobert and Cersei visit Eddard as he recovers at the [[Tower of the Hand]], from wounds sustained fighting Jaime and his guards. Cersei is furious with Eddard for having her brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrested and for fighting with Jaime, but Eddard is unrepentant. She wants Robert to take action against him, but Robert refuses to condemn him, without hearing Eddard's side, and tells her to be silent. When Cersei protests further, and calls Robert a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. Robert tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and Cersei leaves in anger. Afterwards, Robert restores Eddard to his position as King's Hand, and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to Jaime Lannister. He tells Ned to end the animosity between [[House Stark]] and [[House Lannister]], as strife between the two houses could lead them into war, and that he is leaving on a hunt in the Kingswood and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns. Robert goes hunting, taking Selmy, Lancel and Renly with him. Being supplied with wine by Lancel, Robert becomes drunk and nostalgic, and Renly becomes annoyed with Robert for glorifying the &quot;good old days&quot; and leaves the hunt to return to the [[Red Keep|castle]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robert is badly wounded whilst trying to kill a boar while hunting. He is taken back to the capital and on his deathbed tells Joffrey that he wishes he could have been a better father to him. After Robert commands everyone to leave, he names Ned as Lord [[Regent]] and [[Protector of the Realm]]. Eddard has learned that Joffrey, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] are not Robert's children, but are instead the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother Jaime, but is unable to tell the dying Robert this. Robert also asks him to cancel the attempt on Daenerys Targaryen's life but it comes too late to stop the attempt on Daenerys' life. After Robert's death, Cersei destroys the proclamation of Eddard as Regent and Protector of the Realm and has Eddard arrested. Renly also flees the city, after telling Eddard that he would make a better king than his and Robert's other brother (and the rightful heir), [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robert's death sparks the [[War of the Five Kings]] with both of his brothers, Joffrey, [[Balon Greyjoy]], and [[Robb Stark]] crowning themselves as kings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nAt some point prior to his death (possibly as he lay mortally wounded after the boar hunt), Robert specified that he did not want to be buried in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] in King's Landing, where the remains of previous kings from the Targaryen dynasty are interred.
