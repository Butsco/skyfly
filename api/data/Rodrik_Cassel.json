He is played by guest star [[Ron Donachie]] and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming (episode)|series premiere]]. Ser Rodrik Cassel is [[Master-at-Arms]] at [[Winterfell]] and a loyal servant to [[House Stark]]. Even in his old age he is still a skilled warrior. He was executed by [[Theon Greyjoy]] during the [[fall of Winterfell]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Rodrik Cassel is an honorable knight and stalwart warrior, advancing in years but still hale. He is proud of his facial hair, which he cultivates as &quot;whiskers&quot;. He is very unhappy when on the trip to King's Landing he must cut them off. He is fiercely loyal to [[House Stark]]. His older brother Martyn, [[Jory Cassel|Jory]]'s father, died at the Tower of Joy during Robert's Rebellion. Rodrik has married thrice but only has one surviving child, his daughter Beth. He also dislikes musicians.\n\nIn the show, the death of Rodrik Cassel is a combination of the deaths of two other characters in the book: [[Farlen]], the kennelmaster at Winterfell, and Benfred Tallhart, heir to [[House Tallhart]]. Farlen is beheaded by [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], as punishment for killing three of the [[Ironborn]] (who were actually killed by [[Ramsay Snow]] at Theon's command) who participated in the abduction and killing the two boys Theon passes off as Bran and Rickon - Theon knows Farlen is innocent but needs someone had to be punished. Benfred Tallhart, a former friend of Theon and Robb, leads a Northern scout force ambushed at [[Stony Shore]] when they come to confront the ironborn raiders. He refuses to answer questions about the defenses at Torrhen's Square. He insults and spits on Theon, and Theon's uncle [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron Damphair]] tells Theon that he must must be executed for his disrespect. He is drowned on the shores as a sacrifice to the [[Drowned God]]. In the novel, Ser Rodrik dies prior to the [[Sack of Winterfell]] - he is killed by [[Ramsay Snow]], who pretended to have come to aid the Northern host - while besieging Winterfell.\n\nFollowing the [[Sack of Winterfell]], Beth Cassel is brought to the [[Dreadfort]]. Her fate is unknown.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Cassel&quot; is pronounced &quot;Cuss-EL&quot;, not &quot;Kas-el&quot; (that is, &quot;Cassel&quot; doesn't rhyme with &quot;castle&quot;).\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nrodrik-cassel.jpg|Rodrik in &quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;.\nHouse Stark and retainers.jpg|Rodrik stands behind the Stark family as they await the arrival of the king in &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;.\nCatelyn-arrive.png|Rodrik escorts [[Catelyn Stark]] to King's Landing in &quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season One Appearances|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes||yes|yes|yes}}\n{{Season Two Appearances|yes||||yes|yes}}\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nSer Rodrik Cassel is [[Master-at-Arms]] at [[Winterfell]] and has trained many of its soldiers in the art of combat, as well as [[Robb Stark]], [[Theon Greyjoy]] and [[Jon Snow]].

He fought in [[Robert's Rebellion]] and is an old friend of both Lord [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Jon Umber]], the [[Lord of Last Hearth]]. His nephew [[Jory Cassel]] also fought in the rebellion and is the Captain of the guards at Winterfell.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\nSer Rodrik informs Lord [[Eddard Stark]] that [[Will]], a deserter from the [[Night's Watch]], has been caught in the hills. He accompanies Eddard to Will's execution. On the way back to Winterfell he witnesses the discovery of the six [[Direwolves|direwolf]] pups in the Wolfswood. The Stark children adopt the pups. King [[Robert Baratheon]] visits Winterfell and Ser Rodrik assembles with the rest of the household to welcome him. Robert asks Eddard to serve as [[hand of the King]]. [[Bran Stark]] is found severely injured at the base of a disused tower.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Eddard goes south to [[King's Landing]] and [[Jory Cassel|Jory]] accompanies him as the Captain of his personal guard while Rodrik remains in Winterfell. An assassin infiltrates the castle and attempts to kill Bran but is foiled by [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and Bran's direwolf [[Summer]]. Rodrik identifies the blade carried by the assassin as [[Valyrian]] steel. Catelyn suspects [[House Lannister]] and decides to warn Eddard personally. Rodrik offers to send a squad of guards with her but she is concerned about drawing attention. He offers to accompany her personally and she agrees.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRodrik and Catelyn arrive in King's Landing. He escorts her during through the city and they are told that [[Littlefinger]] lost the blade used by the assassin gambling with [[Tyrion Lannister]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; They set out for Winterfell. At the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], Rodrik unsuccessfully attempts to dismiss the singer [[Marillion]]. He helps Catelyn take [[Tyrion Lannister]] prisoner when he arrives at the inn.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Catveil.png|thumb|Ser Rodrik bringing Catelyn and Tyrion through the Vale]]\nThey head east through the Vale of Arryn. Rodrik helps fend off an attack by the hill tribes and receives a minor wound, but is able to complete the journey to [[the Eyrie]]. Rodrik's nephew [[Jory Cassel]] is killed by [[Jaime Lannister]] while protecting Eddard in King's Landing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRodrik witnesses Tyrion's [[First Trial by Combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] and is disappointed when Tyrion's [[Bronn|champion]] wins.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; King Robert dies following a hunting mishap and Eddard questions the lineage of his successor [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. Eddard is arrested for treason and held in the dungeons of King's Landing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Rodrik accompanies Catelyn to [[Moat Cailin]] where they find [[Robb Stark]]'s army camped, where he greets [[Jon Umber]] like a longtime friend.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Robb needs to cross the river trident but is unsure of the support of Lord [[Walder Frey]]. Rodrik advises Catelyn to not go into the Twins alone to talk to Lord Frey. She does so anyway and negotiates safe passage. Robb wins a victory in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and captures Jaime.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; News of Eddard's execution reaches the camp and Rodrik is part of the group that proclaims [[Robb Stark]] the [[King in the North]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\n\nSer Rodrik is present when King Robb presents Ser [[Alton Lannister]] the peace terms he must deliver to the [[Iron Throne]]. Robb sends Ser Rodrik back to [[Winterfell]] to keep [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] safe while Catelyn goes to [[the Stormlands]] to treat with King [[Renly Baratheon]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSer Rodrik enters the Great Hall of Winterfell calling for Bran. He reports that [[Torrhen\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Square]] is under siege. [[Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] is shocked, remarking that Torrhen\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Square is just 14 leagues away and wonders how the Lannisters have reached so far north. [[Osha]] listens intently as she lights candles at the back of the room. Ser Rodrik speculates that it could be a raiding party led by [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] or a group of sellswords. Bran says that they must help their bannermen. Rodrik nods agreement and says that even with most of their forces fighting for Robb he can gather 200 decent men. Luwin wonders if Rodrik needs to take so many and Bran cautions that they must protect their bannermen if they expect their bannermen to protect them. Rodrik smiles at the boy\u00e2&euro;&trade;s wisdom and Bran orders him to leave as soon as he has his men. Rodrik confidently says that it will not take long because southerners do not do well in their territory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Theon Greyjoy]] planned the siege as a diversion and invades the poorly defended Winterfell while Rodrik is away. Rodrik is caught on his way back from Torrhen's Square. He managed to cut down two of Theon's men, before being disarmed by [[Lorren|Black Lorren]].\n\n[[File:RodrickBeforeDeath.png|thumb|Rodrik about to be executed]]\nHe is dragged into Winterfell in a fury at Theon the traitor. Theon is going to have him thrown in the dungeon, but when Ser Rodrik spits in Theon face, [[Dagmer]] says he must sentenced to death (Theon's men will lose respect for him otherwise). Bran is distraught since\u00c2\u00a0Theon had promised earlier that no-one would be harmed if they surrendered. Ser Rodrik tells Bran to be calm, saying &quot;I'm off to see your father.&quot; He\u00c2\u00a0reminds Theon that at Winterfell, the man who passes the sentence swings the blade. Theon asks if Rodrik has any last words before he is beheaded, and Rodrik scornfully replies that Theon is truly lost. Theon botches the execution and it takes three sword strikes and a kick to finally behead Ser Rodrik, to the horror of the onlookers and Bran, who continues sobbing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Rodrik Cassel"}
