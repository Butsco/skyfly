He is one of the many sons of [[Walder Frey]] and is betrothed to [[Arya Stark]].\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Frey family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Arya is betrothed to Elmar Frey. The character has been renamed for the television series. Elmar is the twenty-second son of Lord Walder Frey and the fourth born to Lord Walder's seventh wife, Annara Farring. Elmar is the older brother of [[Shirei Frey]], the youngest child that Lord Walder had with Annara Farring. He is nine years old.\n\nElmar encounters Arya several times in [[Harrenhal]] and tries to boss her around, while mentioning proudly that he is trueborn son of lord [[Walder Frey]] and is going to marry a princess (both of them are unaware that Arya is that princess). Arya is not impressed and does not comply to him. After being informed that [[Robb Stark]] breached the pact with the Freys, Elmar tells Arya whiningly that his father told him he had to marry someone else, or to become a septon. Arya has no sympathy to him.\n\n", "Biography": "===Season 1===\nWhen [[Catelyn Stark]] negotiates with [[Walder Frey]] to gain permission for her son [[Robb Stark]] and his army to pass [[The Twins]], Walder demands that [[Arya Stark]] will marry his son Waldron.
