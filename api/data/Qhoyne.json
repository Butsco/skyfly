It flows out of the [[Forest of Qohor]] south and west before it joins the massive [[Rhoyne]] at [[Dagger Lake]] (which is formed by the confluence of the two rivers). The [[Free City]] of [[Qohor]] lies on the river, near where it emerges from the Forest of Qohor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/myr/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Myr entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Qhoyne is a notable river. [[Ships]] carrying minerals and trade pass south from Qohor along the river to distant [[Volantis]], although the river route is hazardous due to the presence of pirates on Dagger Lake. Qohor maintains a fleet of ships which control the river as far south as the lake.\n\n"}, "title": "Qhoyne"}
