She rebuffed their offer, although she kept the gold.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Daario Naharis]] betrayed his commanders, breached the contract the [[Second Sons]] had with Yunkai and put the two thousand mercenaries at the service of Daenerys&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, the Wise Masters were overthrown during the [[Battle of Yunkai]]. Soon after, many of the newly freed slaves vacated the city and proclaimed Daenerys as her &quot;mother.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, eventually the Wise Masters regained control of the city and re-enslaved the inhabiting freedmen&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. Daenerys, now ruler of [[Meereen]], sent Daario Naharis and his Second Sons back to Yunkai alongside [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]], a Meereenese [[Great Masters|Great Master]] at her service, so that he could offer the Wise Masters the option of abandoning slavery once and for all, or else they would be put to the sword.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mockingbird]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Known Wise Masters": "\n* [[Razdal mo Eraz]]\n* [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n{{SlaversBay}}\n\n"}, "title": "Wise Masters"}
