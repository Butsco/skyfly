It is located at the confluence of the Rhoyne and the Selhoru. It pays tribute to passing [[Dothraki]] ''[[khalasar]]s'', which can easily reach the city from the western-most edge of the [[Dothraki sea]], which is located not far to the east of the settlement. By the standards of the [[Free Cities]], Selhorys is a middling-sized town, although by the standards of [[Westeros]] it would be a small city.\n\n"}, "title": "Selhorys"}
