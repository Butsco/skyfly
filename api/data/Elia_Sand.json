She was named after her aunt, the late Princess [[Elia Martell]].\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nOberyn writes a poem to Elia and mentions her willful behavior to Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]. He explains that he named her after his murdered sister, but this ended up making him sad when he talks to her, which in turn leads to him being angry around her.
