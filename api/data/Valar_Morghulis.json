He is informed by a gloating [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] that he is no longer Acting [[Hand of the King]], as his father [[Tywin Lannister]] has returned to the city and will take over his duties as Hand. [[Varys]] visits and tells him that [[Bronn]] has been relieved of his command of the gold cloaks and his hill tribesmen have gone home with their plunder; Tyrion has lost all of his power. Varys thanks\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion for his part in defending the city, noting that no one else will do so. [[Shae]] urges Tyrion to leave with her for [[Pentos]], but he refuses.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nKing [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] rewards those who served him well in the battle. Lord Tywin Lannister is officially named Hand of the King and Savior of the City. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] is awarded [[Harrenhal]] for brokering the alliance between Houses Lannister and Tyrell. [[Loras Tyrell]] asks that Joffrey wed his sister [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] to unite their houses. Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] and Pycelle make a show of convincing Joffrey to set aside his [[Marriage|betrothal]] to [[Sansa Stark]], given the treachery of [[House Stark]]. Joffrey plays along and agrees to wed Margaery. In private, Sansa is overjoyed to be free, until Littlefinger points out that it will not stop Joffrey from tormenting her; however, he does assure her that he will help her escape, for the sake of her mother.\n\nFollowing his defeat at the Blackwater, [[Stannis Baratheon]] has retreated back to [[Dragonstone]]. He rages at [[Melisandre]] for not foreseeing his defeat, despite her claims to see the future. Melisandre insists that the Lord of Light only allows her glimpses and that Stannis cannot abandon the war because of a single defeat. Stannis accuses her of lying to him, of knowing nothing about war and angrily begins to strangle her. When Melisandre insists her god is in him, Stannis releases her, realizing she is talking about the [[Shadow|creature]] they created to murder [[Renly Baratheon|his brother]]. Melisandre tells Stannis he will betray his men, his family and his beliefs but in the end, it will be worth it; she assures Stannis that he is the Lord's Chosen and he will be king. Stannis is skeptical, but Melisandre has him look into a brazier; Stannis appears to have visions, restoring his faith in the Red Priestess.\n\nIn the Westerlands, King [[Robb Stark]] speaks with his mother [[Catelyn Stark|Lady Catelyn]] regarding his love affair with the woman [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]]. Catelyn urges Robb to remember his vow to wed a daughter of [[House Frey]], or face severe consequences. She says that she and [[Eddard Stark|Robb's father]] didn't love each other when they first married, but that he grew to love her over time. She predicts that Robb and his betrothed might build a similar love over time. Robb disregards her advice and marries Talisa in private that night.\n\n[[File:Brienne Jaime Stark Men 2x10.png|thumb|Jaime recognized by Stark men]]\nTraveling east to [[King's Landing]], [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Jaime Lannister]] come upon the bodies of three women, hanged by Stark soldiers for having slept with Lannister soldiers. When the men return, the pair try to lie their way out of the situation. Jaime is recognized and Brienne is forced to kill the soldiers, demonstrating her prowess as a fighter. When Jaime reminds her that she killed Stark men, Brienne responds that she does not serve House Stark, but [[Catelyn Stark]].\n\nIn [[Winterfell]], [[Theon Greyjoy]] is besieged by a northern army under command of [[Ramsay Snow|Roose Bolton's bastard son]]. [[Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] tells Theon his chances of holding the castle with only twenty men are negligible. Luwin suggests that Theon join the [[Night's Watch]], gaining a chance to redeem himself. When Theon refuses (fearing that Jon Snow will kill him for his betrayal) and tries to rally his men for battle, they betray him; [[Dagmer]] knocks Theon out. When Luwin tries to intervene, Dagmer stabs him with a spear. The ironmen place a bag on Theon and depart Winterfell to deliver him to the Bolton army.\n\nSome time later, [[Bran Stark|Bran]], [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], [[Osha]] and [[Hodor]] emerge from their hiding place in Winterfell's crypts and find the castle burning. They discover the dying Luwin in the [[godswood]]. He insists that the boys must go north to [[the Wall]], as there are too many enemies in the south and Jon will be able to keep them safe and tell their mother of their survival. Luwin affirms his pride at having served the Starks before asking Osha to give him a quick death.\n\nTraveling away from [[Harrenhal]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Gendry]] and [[Hot Pie]] cross paths with [[Jaqen H'ghar]], who has been waiting for them. He offers to take Arya with him to [[Braavos]], where she can learn his skills of killing and find a way to kill those on her list. She refuses, wanting to be reunited with her family. Jaqen gives her a iron coin and the words &quot;Valar Morghulis,&quot; telling her to speak them to any man from Braavos should she ever need to find him again. Jaqen bids Arya farewell, using her real name, and departs, [[Faceless Men|changing his face to that of a different man]] as he leaves.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\n[[File:Daernerys vision Iron Thrones 2x10.jpg|thumb|left|Daenerys in her vision of the Iron Throne room.]]\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] arrives at [[House of the Undying]] and is magically separated from [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] and [[Kovarro]]. She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors. She chooses one and opens it. She is presented with tempting visions. First the snowy, ruined throne room of King's Landing where she turns away from the [[Iron Throne]]. She then walks through the gates of the Wall surrounded by more snow, and into [[Drogo]]'s tent. She finds Drogo and what would have been her infant son [[Rhaego]]. They talk about whose dream they are in, and Daenerys silently leaves after touching Rhaego's hair. She returns to the room with many doors and finds her [[dragons]] chained to a pedestal in front of her. [[Pyat Pree]] appears and explains that she and her brood are the source of his restored magic and that they make each other stronger. Daenerys is also chained by Pyat's magic. The young queen is unconcerned however, and simply regards Pree with a cool, almost lazy gaze. She calmly utters a single word:\u00c2\u00a0&quot;[[High Valyrian|Dracarys]]&quot;; after a couple of tries, all three dragons unleash their fiery breath, and\u00c2\u00a0Pyat Pree is incinerated.\n\nDaenerys knows that [[Xaro]] has betrayed her. She returns to his palace to confront him and finds [[Doreah]] in bed with him. She takes his key and uses it to open his Valyrian stone vault. She is surprised when it is empty, but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing. On her orders, Doreah and Xaro are locked into the empty vault to die, their pleas cut off by the closing door. Daenerys salvages enough from Xaro's household to buy a ship. On Jorah's orders, the Dothraki seize Xaro's gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\n[[File:Wilding's Camp 2x10.png|thumb|left|The King-Beyond-the-Wall's Camp.]]\n[[Jon Snow]] and [[Qhorin Halfhand]] are marched towards the camp of the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], [[Mance Rayder]], as captives of the [[Lord of Bones]]. Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings, so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword, attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery. The Lord of Bones lets them fight, and [[Ygritte]] gives Jon back his sword. Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage. After a fierce duel, Jon mortally wounds Qhorin per Qhorin's own instructions, who whispers to Jon &quot;We are the watchers on the Wall&quot; before he breathed his last, signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding Jon that he must find out all he can about the wildings plans and get back to the Wall. By killing Qhorin, the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him. Impressed, the Lord of Bones cuts Jon free. Ygritte shows him their vast army, gathering in a valley below. She promises to take him to their King and, with no other choice, Jon follows her.\n\nAt the [[Fist of the First Men]], [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]], [[Grenn]] and [[Dolorous Edd|Edd]] are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts; the warning call for [[White Walkers]]. The three run back to the Fist. Sam is left behind, caught in a sudden blizzard. Seeing shadowy figures moving through the blizzard, Sam hides behind a rock and watches as dozens of\u00c2\u00a0[[Wights]] walk past him,\u00c2\u00a0led by a White Walker riding an undead horse-wight. Sam cowers in fear the White Walker appears to simply ignore him and ride forward.  It then commands its army of wights and White Walkers, numbering several hundred, to advance on the Fist.\n\n", "Production": "===Cast===\n{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Charles Dance]] as Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Richard Madden]] as King [[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as Prince [[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Sophie Turner]] as Princess [[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as Prince [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[John Bradley]] as [[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Jack Gleeson]] as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Natalie Dormer]] as Lady [[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Stephen Dillane]] as King [[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Carice van Houten]] as [[Melisandre]]\n*[[Conleth Hill]] as Lord [[Varys]]\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as [[Shae]]\n\n'''Also Starring'''\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as Khal [[Drogo]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Guest starring'''\n*[[Donald Sumpter]] as [[Maester]] [[Luwin]]\n*[[Julian Glover]] as [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]]\n*[[Ian Hanmore]] as [[Pyat Pree]]\n*[[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]]\n*[[Tom Wlaschiha]] as [[Jaqen H'ghar]]\n*[[Simon Armstrong]] as [[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n*[[Gwendoline Christie]] as [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Rose Leslie]] as [[Ygritte]]\n*[[Nonso Anozie]] as [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Gendry]]\n*[[Oona Chaplin]] as Lady [[Talisa Maegyr]]\n*[[Esme Bianco]] as [[Ros]]\n*[[Finn Jones]] as Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]]\n*[[Ben Crompton]] as [[Eddison Tollett]]\n*[[Ben Hawkey]] as [[Hot Pie]]\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as [[Dagmer|Dagmer Cleftjaw]]\n*[[Roxanne McKee]] as [[Doreah]]\n*[[Steven Cole]] as [[Kovarro]]\n*[[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n*[[Art Parkinson]] as Prince [[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Edward Dogliani]] as [[Lord of Bones]]\n*[[Forbes KB]] as [[Lorren|Black Lorren]]\n*[[Daniel Portman]] as [[Podrick Payne]]\n*[[Patrick O'Kane]] as [[Jaqen H'ghar|Jaqen's New Face]]\n*[[Michael Shaeffer]] as a [[Stark soldier (Valar Morghulis)|Stark soldier]]\n*[[Christopher Reilly]] as [[Tom|Soldier Tom]]\n*[[Terry Byrne]] as a [[Septon (Valar Morghulis)|Septon]]\n*[[Ross Mullan]] as a [[White Walker (Valar Morghulis)|White Walker]]\n*[[Wren Ros Elliot-Sloan]] as [[Rhaego]]\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n====Cast notes====\n*Only 21 of the 25 starring cast members for the second season appear in this episode.\n*Starring cast members [[James Cosmo]] ([[Jeor Mormont]]), [[Liam Cunningham]] ([[Davos Seaworth]]), [[Jerome Flynn]] ([[Bronn]]) and [[Rory McCann]] ([[Sandor Clegane]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n*[[Natalie Dormer]] is credited ahead of [[Stephen Dillane]] when she was credited after him when they last appeared together in &quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]].&quot;\n*[[Natalie Dormer]] is credited ahead of [[Carice van Houten]] when she was credited after her when they last appeared together in &quot;[[Garden of Bones]].&quot;\n*[[Richard Madden]], [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]], [[Maisie Williams]], [[Alfie Allen]] and [[John Bradley]] are credited ahead of [[Jack Gleeson]] when they were credited after him when they last appeared together in &quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]].&quot;\n*[[Sophie Turner]] is credited ahead of [[Jack Gleeson]] when she was credited after him when they last appeared together in &quot;[[Blackwater]].&quot;\n* [[Jason Momoa]] ([[Khal Drogo]]) is credited as 'also starring' during the closing credits of this episode.\n\n", "Notes": "*''Valar Morghulis'' is a common greeting in [[Braavos]], meaning &quot;all men must die&quot; in [[High Valyrian]]. It is meant in the sense of &quot;all men must (eventually) die&quot;, sooner or later, somewhat like the Latin saying &quot;''memento mori''&quot;. The customary response is ''Valar Dohaeris'' \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; &quot;all men must serve&quot;. The actual translation is not mentioned in the episode and was not provided until ''[[Walk of Punishment]]''.\n*The episode was 10 minutes longer than usual to allow for the resolution of the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and setting up new story lines for the third season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/GraphicCity/news/?a=60605 Comic Book Movie News reporting on the extended finale]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Executive Producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss decided to play a practical joke on Alfie Allen (who plays Theon Greyjoy), by giving him a fake script for the season finale, in which Bran Stark kills Theon Greyjoy, in a massive departure from the novels. Their hope was to get a rise out of Allen, on seeing that his character was not only unexpectedly killed off, but by none other than Bran. However, instead of being frustrated, Allen actually thought that such a major departure was an intriguing idea, to the point that he didn't realize it was a joke for quite some time, just a bold change the writers were making. Thus he had no particularly strong reaction to the fake script. Some time later they called him on the phone to say that they were thinking of bringing Theon back as a [[wight]] with no dialogue, which was so obviously a joke that Allen realized they'd just been trying to play a prank on him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Comic_Con_Panel_Video/ Westeros.org]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The sword fight scene between Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand was filmed on a cliff with a 500 foot drop. It was a two day shoot, and they were sinking into the snow which left them both exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Access Hollywood Interview : Kit Harrington on Filming &quot;Difficult&quot; and &quot;Emotional&quot; Game of Thrones Season 2 Finale&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The final sequence of the camera panning away to reveal the White Walkers and their army of hundreds of wights was meant to be filmed in Iceland in November 2011. However, the producers weren't happy with the White Walker costumes from Season 1, and they wanted to redesign them for their full reveal in the Season 2 finale (as up until this point they've just been glimpsed in the shadows). This meant the final scene had to be reshot on a sound stage in London. The design changes took so long that by the time they had finished, director Alan Taylor had to leave to work on ''Thor: The Dark World'' and was unavailable to film the reshoots. As it was primarily a special effects sequence being produced by the TV series' special effects studio [[Pixomondo]], the sound stage reshoots were ultimately directed by Pixomondo\u00e2&euro;&trade;s visual effects supervisor Rainer Gombos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcocreate.com/1681718/collaboration-isnt-always-pretty-behind-the-emmy-winning-vfx-for-game-of-thrones?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+fastcocreate/feed+%28Co.Create%29#1 Fastcocreate.com] &quot;Collaboration Isn\u00e2&euro;&trade;t Always Pretty\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;Behind The Emmy-Winning VFX For \u00e2&euro;&oelig;Game Of Thrones\u00e2&euro;?&lt;/ref&gt;\n**No less than 1,000 [[wight]]s are depicted in the closing special effects shot. This was achieved by the series' special effects group Pixomondo using only fifty extras, digitally doubled up to make the entire army. Roughly 10-30 White Walkers are interspersed among them. However, only one full version of the redesigned White Walker costume had been created, so only one stunt man played all of the White Walkers, digitally doubled up (and sometimes wearing different equipment to try to distinguish them).\n*At the end of the episode, when Daenerys' followers are ransacking Xaro Xhoan Daxos' palace, Jorah says in subtitled [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]], &quot;take all the gold and jewels!&quot; This was added with only a few hours before shooting had to wrap, but the crew was not able to contact language consultant [[David J. Peterson]] in time. Because [[Iain Glen]] (Jorah) has delivered a large amount of Dothraki dialogue before, the crew asked him to just ad-lib the line as best he could. The correct way to say this exact line in Dothraki is &quot;''Fichas ei hoshor ma dan''&quot;, but the line that Glen ad-libbed was something close to &quot;''Mas ovray movekkhi moskay''&quot;. Peterson retroactively came up with a translation so Jorah's line would make sense in Dothraki, with the literal translation, &quot;The remaining valuables are for loading.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dothraki.com/2012/06/hash-yer-ast-fin/ David J. Peterson's blog], Dothraki.com, June 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Fans frequently asked the writers why Robb Stark and Talisa were married by a septon of the [[Faith of the Seven]], when he apparently follows the [[Old Gods of the Forest]] like his father did. Writer [[Bryan Cogman]] explained that they just wanted to get quickly married in secret and there was a septon readily available. Cogman pointed out that Robb was raised in an interfaith household, since as his mother Catelyn follows the Faith and Eddard even married her in the sept at [[Riverrun]]. Robb therefore wouldn't be uncomfortable with a ceremony of the Faith of the Seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&amp;A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Memorable quotes": "{{Quote|Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself, and came back here to wait for you.|Khal Drogo to Daenerys in a vision|Valar Morghulis}}\n{{Quote|I need to find my brother and mother.
