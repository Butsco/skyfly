It is wrapped this way to carefully display the dangling fringes which are usually adorned with some decoration, typically gold or pearls . If wound too loose, the tokar might unravel and fall off. If it is wound too tight, it might tangle and trip the wearer. Even if wound properly the wearer must hold the tokar in place with their left hand and walking requires small steps and great balance to prevent tripping and falling. The point of the garment is to show that the wearer is powerful and wealthy enough that he or she doesn't require to perform any kind of manual labor.\n\n"}, "title": "Tokar"}
