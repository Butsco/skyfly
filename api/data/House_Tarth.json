Crescent moon, some starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father?|Jaime Lannister to Brienne|Prince of Winterfell}}\n'''House Tarth''' is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]]. The family controls the island of [[Tarth]], which lies in the [[Narrow Sea]] just off the coast of the [[Stormlands]]. Their seat is called [[Evenfall Hall]].\n\nHouse Tarth is ruled by Lord [[Selwyn Tarth]], a widower. His sole surviving child and heir is [[Brienne]], whom he dotes on. Brienne, a tall and broad-shouldered woman, prefers the lifestyle of a warrior to that of a typical daughter of a noble house, and is skilled at arms.\n\nHouse Tarth's [[Heraldry|heraldry]] consists of yellow suns on rose quartered with white crescents on azure. Their words are not known.\n\nAfter [[Renly Baratheon]]'s death, House Tarth refused to swear allegiance to Stannis and declared for [[Joffrey Baratheon]] instead.\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Tarth family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tarth has been a loyal vassal of the Baratheons for many generations. With King [[Robert Baratheon]] away at court and [[Stannis Baratheon]] serving as Lord of [[Dragonstone]], the Tarths, like most of the Stormland houses, regard [[Renly Baratheon]], the Lord of Storm's End, with greater loyalty and affection than his two brothers.\n\nAfter Renly dies, it isn't clearly stated whom Lord Selwyn and House Tarth officially support. Selwyn certainly didn't send troops to aid Stannis, but it's unclear if he bent the knee to Joffrey, outright lent his support to him, or simply adopted an isolationist stance, like Lord Gulian Swann.\n\n", "Members": "* Lord [[Selwyn Tarth]], called &quot;the Evenstar&quot;, the head of the family and Lord of Evenfall Hall.\n** [[Brienne of Tarth]], his only surviving child and heir.\n\nWith unspecified familiar relationship to the main branch there is also:\n*Ser [[Endrew Tarth]], a member of the [[Night's Watch]].\n\n"}, "title": "House Tarth"}
