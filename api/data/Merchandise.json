Martin]], which have been adapted into the HBO TV series, is the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series. The first novel is named ''A Game of Thrones'', from which HBO decided to title the entire TV series as &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Martin has also written various side stories and prequel novellas which are not part of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series proper, though they are set in the same fictional world and reveal more backstory relevant to the main series.\n\n===''A Song of Ice and Fire'': the main series novels===\n\n# ''A Game of Thrones''\u00c2\u00a0(1996) - after which the TV series is named. Adapted as Season 1 of the TV series.\n# ''A Clash of Kings''\u00c2\u00a0(1998) - adapted as Season 2.\n# ''A Storm of Swords''\u00c2\u00a0(2000) - so long that it had to be split into two TV seasons: Season 3 adapted the first half, while Season 4 adapted the second half.\n# ''A Feast for Crows''\u00c2\u00a0(2005)\n# ''A Dance with Dragons''\u00c2\u00a0(2011) - books 4 and 5 were originally one novel, but grew so impractically long that they were split into two separate books. The events of both occur concurrently. Book 4 follows the storylines of characters in the Seven Kingdoms themselves (including all plotlines in King's Landing), while Book 5 covers the storylines of characters outside of the Seven Kingdoms (Jon Snow and the Night's Watch, Daenerys Targaryen in Slaver's Bay, and Tyrion as he flees to the Free Cities).\n# ''The Winds of Winter''\u00c2\u00a0(forthcoming)\n# ''A Dream of Spring''\u00c2\u00a0(forthcoming)\n\n===''The Tales of Dunk and Egg'' (prequel novellas)===\n\n''The Tales of Dunk and Egg'' are a series of prequel novellas set about 90 years before the events of the main ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series. Legal negotiations are taking place to adapt them as a [[Tales of Dunk and Egg|potential prequel]] to the main ''Game of Thrones'' TV series, though production would only begin after the main series has concluded.\n\n# ''The Hedge Knight'' (1998)\n# ''The Sworn Sword'' (2002)\n# ''The Mystery Knight'' (2009)\n# ''The She-Wolves of Winterfell'' (forthcoming)\n* ''Tales of Dunk and Egg: Volume One'' (omnibus, forthcoming)\n\nThrough his blog, Martin his indicated that &quot;The She-Wolves of Winterfell&quot; was just a working title, and that the final title when it is released will be something else.  Another forthcoming Dunk &amp; Egg story which he has fairly well planned out is called &quot;The Village Hero&quot; and takes place in the Riverlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others he intends to write include &quot;The Sellsword&quot;, &quot;The Champion&quot;, &quot;The Kingsguard&quot;, and &quot;The Lord Commander&quot;, along with several as-yet untitled story ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?page=3 ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Dance of the Dragons prequel novellas===\n\n# ''The Princess and the Queen'' (2013)\n# ''The Rogue Prince'' (2014)\n\n===Companion books to the novel series===\n* ''The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume I'' (2005)\n* ''The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume II'' (2011)\n* ''A Feast of Ice and Fire'' (2012) - a fan-produced cookbook attempting to recreate the [[Food and Drink]] featured in the novels.\n* ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' (2012) - a collection of posters depicting exclusive, highly detailed maps of the locations in the novels.\n* ''The World of Ice and Fire'' (2014) - a detailed sourcebook about the backstory of Westeros, presented as an in-universe history textbook.\n\n==Extra-universe books: works written about the TV series and novels==\n[[File:Living-language-dothraki.jpg|thumb|''Living Language Dothraki'']]\n:''See: [[:Category:Books (extra-universe)]]''\n\n*''[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones]] (Seasons 1 &amp; 2)''\n*''[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 &amp; 4]]''\n*''[[Living Language Dothraki]]''\n\n", "Computer games": ":''See [[:Category:Computer games]]''\n\nThese are video games and app games based on ''Game of Thrones'', though none are officially part of the TV continuity.\n\n*''[[Battle for the Iron Throne (online game)|Battle for the Iron Throne]]'' (2011) - an online game.\n*''[[Game of Thrones (2012 role-playing game)|Game of Thrones]]'' (2012) -a role-playing game, for Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.  \n*''[[Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series]]'' (2014)\n*''[[Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms]]'' (TBA) - an online browser-based MMORPG.

Television Figurines''' are a series of 3.75 inch vinyl figurines based on characters from various TV series, including HBO's ''Game of Thrones''. They are not highly detailed or an attempt to be photo-realistic, but instead a cute cartoon version of characters, with oversized heads. While they are not as detailed as &quot;action figures&quot; or other figurines, by the same token they are cheaper to produce, so they come in a much greater variety than regular action figures. Many characters who have never appeared as photo-realistic action figures do have Pop! figurines modeled after them.\n\nFunko Pop! figurines produced so far include:\n\n*Ned Stark\n*Robb Stark\n*[[Sansa Stark]]\n*Arya Stark\n*Jon Snow\n*[[Ghost]], Jon Snow's [[Direwolves|direwolf]]\n*[[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Ygritte]]\n*[[Hodor]]\n*Tywin Lannister\n*Cersei Lannister\n*Jaime Lannister (Season 1)\n*Tyrion Lannister\n*Joffrey Baratheon\n*Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane\n*[[Petyr Baelish|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish]]\n*Daenerys Targaryen (Season 2, Dothraki costume)\n*Daenerys Targaryen (Season 3, blue riding dress)\n*Khal Drogo\n*[[Drogon]] the dragon.\n*A White Walker\n*[[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Brienne of Tarth]]\n\n"}, "title": "Merchandise"}
