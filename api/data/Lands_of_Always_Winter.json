They are so-named as snow falls in these lands even in the warmest summers. The [[Free Folk|wildlings]] control some of this territory, but it also extends into subarctic wastelands that are not hospitable to human life. These lands are said to lie north of even the [[Haunted Forest]] and the [[Frozen Shore]], [[beyond the Wall]]. The [[White Walkers]] may originate in this region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/frostfang-mountains/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Frostfangs entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "[[Image:Lands of Always Winter.png|thumb|right|200px|A map showing the rough location of the Lands of Always Winter on the continent of Westeros.]]\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Lands of Always Winter are mostly unexplored. They lie beyond the northern-most wildling kingdom, the land of the [[Thenn]]s in the northern valleys of the [[Frostfangs]]. The wildlings believe that the White Walkers come from this region, but even the northernmost wildling tribes have little if any knowledge of the region - as few who have ventured so far north have ever lived to tell about it, if only due to the deathly cold temperatures.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 4]]===\n[[File:LandsOfAlwaysWinter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A White Walker rides through the frozen wasteland of the Lands of Always Winter.]]\nA [[White Walker (Oathkeeper)|White Walker]] seizes the [[Craster's last son|last son]] of the [[Free Folk|wildling]] [[Craster]] and takes him all the way to the Lands of Always Winter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Lands of Always Winter"}
