It is narrated by [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] and [[Richard Madden]] as [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Robb Stark]].\n\n", "Synopsis": "[[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Robb Stark]] discuss [[House Stark]]'s reign as the [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] before kneeling to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]].\n\n", "Summary": "Bran describes how the [[House Stark|Starks]] of [[Winterfell]] trace their descent to the [[First Men]] in the [[Age of Heroes]]. The family's founder was [[Brandon the Builder]] who, in the aftermath of [[the Long Night]] helped establish the [[Night's Watch]]. According to legend, Bran the Builder enlisted the aid of [[giants]] and the [[magic]] of the [[Children of the Forest]] to raise [[the Wall]], which has protected the realm for generations. Then, he went on to build Winterfell and reign as the first [[King in the North]].\n\nRobb narrates how the Starks reigned as Kings for thousands of years, resisting even the invasion of the [[Andals]] as the southron kingdoms fell and the Children were driven [[Beyond the Wall|north]]. Under the rule of the Starks, [[the North]] kept its own religion and its way of life.\n\nHowever, the reign of the Kings of Winter came to an end with the [[War of Conquest|coming]] of [[Aegon the Conqueror]]. After Aegon and his [[dragons]] destroyed the armies of [[the Reach]] and [[Westerlands|the Rock]] in the [[Field of Fire]], King [[Torrhen Stark]] bent the knee and swore loyalty to [[House Targaryen]] in order to spare his people. He was forever after known as &quot;the King Who Knelt&quot;. As a reward for his submission, Torrhen was declared Lord of Winterfell and [[Warden of the North]].\n\nBran tells of how the Starks take great pride in their history and traditions, being one of the few noble houses that still keeps to the [[Old Gods]], and mentions the large [[weirwood]] tree growing in the [[godswood]] of Winterfell. Bran also mentions the Starks' ancestral greatsword, [[Ice]], forged in ancient [[Valyria]] and passed down through generations. Then, he goes on to mention the Starks' constant support of the [[Night's Watch]], even as the ancient order has fallen on hard times.\n\nBran then compares the legendary status of the Stark sigil, the grey [[direwolf]], to that of the family itself in the North and throughout the [[Seven Kingdoms]] . Bran and Robb intone the Stark family words, &quot;[[Winter is Coming (motto)|Winter is Coming]] &quot;, which serve as a reminder of their beginnings, in the wake of the Long Night and - Robb finishes the narration - the grim moments of life to come.\n\n"}, "title": "House Stark (Complete Guide to Westeros)"}
