She is played by guest star [[Gemma Whelan]] and debuts in &quot;[[The Night Lands]].&quot;\u00c2\u00a0Yara\u00c2\u00a0is an [[ironborn]], [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon Greyjoy's]] older sister and his only surviving sibling. She\u00c2\u00a0was raised at [[Pyke]], the stronghold of [[House Greyjoy]]. Yara is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels Yara is called '''Asha Greyjoy''', but her name was changed in the TV series; possibly to prevent confusion with [[Osha]] the wildling. Ironically, as the daughter of a Great House and one of Balon Greyjoy's only two surviving children, Asha Greyjoy is actually a much more prominent character than Osha the wildling; Asha Greyjoy is even a POV character in several chapters. Thus it is curious why they changed Asha's name and not the other way around. It is probably because Osha was already introduced in Season 1 and the similarity with Asha Greyjoy's name wasn't realized until production on Season 2 began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2011/07/asha-renamed-and-cast/ WinterIsComing.net], &quot;Asha Renamed and Cast?&quot;, July 7th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the German dub of the TV series, however, the character is still called &quot;Asha&quot; as in the books.\n\nAnother small change is that in the books, &quot;Asha Greyjoy&quot; has short black hair, a lean build, and a sharp beak of a nose. In the TV series, &quot;Yara Greyjoy&quot; has blonde hair. Other than these minor naming and cosmetic differences, Gemma Whelan's portrayal is actually quite faithful to Asha Greyjoy's behavior and actions in the books.\n\nBalon is greatly proud of his wild headstrong daughter, and believes she can succeed him, although it is doubtful the other ironborn would accept her as their queen. He wishes Theon dead so he would not stand in Asha's way.\n\nAsha's uncles [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]], [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]], and Rodrik &quot;the Reader&quot; Harlaw respect her and acknowledge her power, but do not believe she can rule the ironborn due to her gender. Other ironborn often mock Asha ribaldy. However, Asha is confident and strong-willed enough to dismiss such attitude scornfully, and she always talks back sharply and make fun of those who taunt her.\n\nAsha's crew adore her devotedly. Half of them love her as their daughter, the other half want to have sex with her, and all of them would die for her.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|She's commanded men. She's killed men.

Balon is the head of [[House Greyjoy]] and the [[Lord of the Iron Islands]]. The [[Iron Islands]] are one of the constituent regions of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and House Greyjoy is one of the [[Great Houses]] of the realm. House Greyjoy rules the region from their seat at [[Pyke (castle)|Pyke]] and Balon also holds the title [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].\n\nYara was born and raised at Pyke. She was Balon and Alannys's third child after [[Rodrik Greyjoy|Rodrik]] and [[Maron Greyjoy|Maron]]. She also has a younger brother, [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]. Eight years before the start of the series, Balon rose in [[Greyjoy Rebellion|rebellion]] against the [[Iron Throne]] and was defeated in a bloody war. Balon's older two sons were killed and Theon was taken by Lord [[Eddard Stark]] as a hostage for Balon's good behavior and obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balon Greyjoy viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/balon-greyjoy/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Greyjoy - Balon Greyjoy entry]&lt;/ref&gt; With Yara as Balon's only remaining child in the Iron Islands, he raised her as a surrogate son, encouraging her to become a reaver in her own right, which is unusual for women in the misogynistic culture of the [[ironborn]]. She is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship, to the disquiet of some of the ironborn who hold that women should not fight or command men in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yara Greyjoy viewers guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/yara-greyjoy/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Greyjoy - Yara Greyjoy entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\n[[File:Yara.png|thumb|left|Yara and Theon riding at Pyke.]]\nTheon has returned to [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]] as an envoy from King [[Robb Stark]]. Yara rides out to greet him, posing as a commoner to get the measure of her brother. She offers him a lift on her horse up to the castle Pyke. He does not recognize her and is relentless in his attempts to seduce her. He presents Robb's suggested alliance to their father, [[Balon Greyjoy]]. Balon roundly rejects the terms, insisting that he is [[ironborn]]\u00c2\u00a0and will seize his crown. He compares Theon unfavorably to Yara, revealing her identity. He says that Yara will lead his assault.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Balon details a plan to attack the poorly defended north while Robb is distracted by his war with House Lannister. Yara is assigned thirty ships to seize [[Deepwood Motte]], the stronghold of [[House Glover]], while Theon is given a single ship to raid fishing villages along the [[Stony Shore]]. Theon is baptized by [[Drowned Priest|a Drowned Priest]] on the shores of Pyke in a show of loyalty to his blood relatives.
