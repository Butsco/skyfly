Weiss]] wanted a &quot;full, memorable version&quot; of &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; that would act as &quot;memorable ending&quot; to the &quot;Blackwater&quot; episode. Hence, they &quot;tossed around the names of a bunch of artists and bands that we liked and whom we thought would fit the tone of the song.&quot; When Florence + the Machine declined owing to another soundtrack commitment, they landed on the National. \u00c2\u00a0\n\nComposer [[Ramin Djawadi]]\u00c2\u00a0commented: &quot;When we started doing this, it was not known we would do such a thing. It was us saying internally, 'Hey, it would be cool if we took this theme and had a band do it.' We asked them, 'This is what we're thinking \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; \u00c2\u00a0would you guys be into it?'&quot;\n\nThe band agreed and since Djawadi had already composed the melody for &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; earlier in the season, the National was tasked with fleshing out a full arrangement during a session at his studio.&quot;I had done my demo mock-up minus the vocal,&quot; said Djawadi. &quot;And then we shaped it a bit, took the instruments out, and the band did their treatment, with a cool vibe to it.&quot; The showrunners were pleased, to say the least. &quot;The rich mournfulness of Matt Berninger's voice and Aaron Dessner's understated arrangements fit perfectly with the haunting song Ramin had written,&quot; said Benioff and Weiss. &quot;It's impossible to imitate Matt's voice. Go ahead and try it \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; you'll just sound silly when you drop into that register. But he sounds perfect. Every time we hear him sing 'Rains,' it makes us happy \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; in a foreboding, melancholy way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/game-of-thrones-behind-the-music.html Vulture]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Discography": "*''The National'' (2001)\n*''Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers'' (2003)\n*''\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Alligator'' (2005)\n*''Boxer'' (2007)\n*''High Violet'' (2010)\n*''Trouble Will Find Me'' (2013)\n\n", "Members": "*Matt Berninger - vocals\n*Aaron Dessner - rhythm guitar, keyboards, harmonica, vibraphone\n*Bryce Dessner - lead guitar, keyboards, e-bow, orchestration\n*Bryan Devendorf - drums, percussion\n*Scott Devendorf - bass guitar\n"}, "title": "The National"}
