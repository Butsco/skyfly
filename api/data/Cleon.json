It was said he could cut up a pig faster than any other man in Astapor.

The TV series added the detail that he styles himself as &quot;His Imperial Majesty&quot; - thus while he proclaimed himself &quot;King Cleon&quot; in the books, it isn't clear if his official title is &quot;Emperor Cleon&quot; in the TV series.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nCleon was one of the thousands of [[slavery|slaves]] liberated after the [[Sack of Astapor]].
