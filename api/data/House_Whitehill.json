The guidebook presented lists of multiple minor Houses with new heraldry and sometimes a note or two about them. Therefore House Whitehill is ''broadly'' part of the &quot;book continuity&quot;, and was not ''entirely'' invented from scratch by Telltale Games.\n\nThe only information provided about House Whitehill was their heraldry, and that they are one of the few Northern families to follow the Faith of the Seven instead of the Old Gods. The heraldry of House Whitehill consists of a white pile (wedge) inverted on indigo, an arch of four-pointed stars above.\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nWhitehill banner.png|The sigil of House Whitehill on a banner.\nWhitehill.png|An alternative sigil of House Whitehill from the game files.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Members": "*[[Ludd Whitehill]], Lord of Whitehill, and head of the family.\n**[[Gryff Whitehill]], his fourth-born son.\n**[[Gwyn Whitehill]], his eldest daughter.\n\n===Household===\n*{[[Britt Warrick]]}, a man-at-arms in the service of Lord Whitehill.\n*[[Fegg]], a man-at-arms stationed at Ironrath.\n*[[Andros]], a merchant lord tied to House Whitehill.\n*[[Morgryn]], a merchant lord tied to House Whitehill.\n*[[Ryon Forrester]], Lord Whitehill's ward.\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF|House Whitehill}}\n", "History": "===Background===\nHouse Whitehill are bitter rivals of [[House Forrester]] of [[Ironrath]], and have served House Bolton as bannerman for five centuries.
