She initially appeared as a recurring character in the [[Season 4|fourth]] season. She is portrayed by [[Indira Varma]].  She is the [[Paramour|paramour]] of Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] of [[Dorne]] and a [[bastard]] of [[House Uller]]. &quot;Sand&quot; is the surname used for noble-born bastards in Dorne, much like Snow in [[the North]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ellaria Sand is the paramour of Prince Oberyn Martell. She is the [[bastard]] daughter of Lord Harmen Uller, the Lord of [[Hellholt]] - thus she is one of the &quot;Sandy [[Dornishmen]]&quot; of the central desert of [[Dorne]], who possess particularly dark skin, burned brown by the hot desert sun. Her hair and eyes are also black.\n\nEllaria is the mother of the four youngest of Oberyn's eight bastard daughters, who are all collectively known as the &quot;Sand Snakes&quot;. Ellaria's four daughters with Oberyn are named Elia, Obella, Dorea, and Loreza Sand.\n\nShe is described as not explicitly beautiful, as she is no longer a young woman and has borne four children, though still attractive and eye-catching, with an exotic, sensuous flair. Like her partner Oberyn, she expresses sexual interest in both women and men. It is not unusual for lords and ladies in Dorne to be openly bisexual, due to the relaxed attitude towards sexuality among the Dornish.\n\n[[Olenna Tyrell]] has a low opinion of the Dornish custom of having paramours (formal mistresses), and calls Ellaria &quot;The Serpent's [[whore]]&quot;.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|Why don't [[Olyvar|you]] use the right words.

When\u00c2\u00a0[[Olyvar]]\u00c2\u00a0calls Ellaria &quot;my lady&quot;, she calls him out for using a lie to address her and tells him to call her what she is: a\u00c2\u00a0[[bastard]].

On this occasion, Ellaria is serviced by [[Marei]] and another woman; Ellaria steals a kiss from Olyvar, who apologizes and says he simply hasn't developed the taste for women. Ellaria soothes Oberyn's anger at the suggestion that she is an &quot;acquired taste&quot;, by reminding him that this means he has Olyvar to himself. Ellaria leaves when Lord Tywin unexpectedly shows up and asks to meet privately with Oberyn, but says that Oberyn need only call if he needs her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Ellaria_terrified_-_The_Mountain_and_the_Viper.png|thumb|left|Ellaria screams in horror as she watches the brutal death of Oberyn.]]\nDuring Tyrion's trial by combat, Ellaria, in spite of having heard tales of the Mountain for years, is somewhat disturbed to see exactly how large he really is, expressing with disbelief, &quot;you're going to fight ''that''?!&quot;. Ellaria watches with Tyrion from the sidelines and is delighted when it looks like Oberyn has won. Her delight turns to shock and horror when the Mountain gains the upper hand on Oberyn and crushes his skull, at which she can do nothing but scream.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Ellaria Sand"}
