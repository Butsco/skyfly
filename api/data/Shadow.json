She needs to use Stannis' own life-essence to fuel the entities, but this hugely drains him, thus she doesn't produce any more shadows. Davos notices that Stannis looks ten years older than before the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Use of the creatures is thus limited in case their creation taxes the creator to the point of death. Melisandre offers Davos to use his life-essence to produce a shadow, but he refuses. It is unknown whether Melisandre made similar offers to any other men.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\n[[File:RenlysDeathS2Ep5.png|thumb|right|200px|The shadow creature assassinates Renly.]]\n[[Melisandre]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]] had sex, with Melisandre promising to give Stannis 'a son'.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed parley between Stannis and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], Melisandre is revealed to be pregnant.
