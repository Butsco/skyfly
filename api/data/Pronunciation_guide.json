As such, it covers most but not all of the names used in Season 1, particularly major characters and locations. Moreover, it doesn't include characters introduced after Season 1.\n\nWriter [[Bryan Cogman]] clarified that some pronunciations would differ due to the accents and languages of the speaker. &quot;Ser&quot; in particular will vary.\n\n", "Miscellaneous": "*[[Andals]] - AN-dals\n*[[Arakh]] - Ah-rock\n*[[Dothraki]] - Doth-RACK-ee\n*[[khalasar]] - KHAL-uh-ssar\n*[[Khaleesi]] - Khal-EE-see\n*[[Ser]] - SAIR\n*[[Tyrosh]]i - Ti-ROH-shee\n*[[Valyrian]] - Vuh-LEER-ee-un\n\n", "Character names": "*[[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]] - AIR-eez Tar-GAIR-ee-in\n*[[Alliser Thorne]] - AL-iss-er THORNE\n*[[Arya Stark]] - ARE-yuh STARK [pronounced as ''two'' quick syllables, not three syllables like &quot;are-ee-uh&quot;]\n*[[Barristan Selmy]] - BAIR-iss-tin SELL-mee\n*[[Benjen Stark]] - BEN-jin STARK\n*[[Catelyn Stark]] - CAT-lin STARK (&quot;cat&quot; like the animal)\n*[[Cersei Lannister]] - SER-see LAN-iss-ter\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]] - Duh-NAIR-iss Tar-GAIR-ee-in\n*[[Eddard Stark]] - ED-dard STARK\n*[[Gendry]] - GEN-dree (hard &quot;g&quot;)\n*[[Gregor Clegane]] - Gre-GOR Cli-GAIN\n*[[Hodor]] - HO-dor\n*[[Hoster Tully]] - HOSS-ter TULL-ee\n*[[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]] - Il-LEAR-ee-oh\n*[[Ilyn Payne]] - ILL-in PAIN\n*[[Irri]] - I-ree\n*[[Janos Slynt]] - JA-nos SLINT\n*[[Jeor Mormont]] - JEE-or MORE-mont\n*[[Joffrey Baratheon]] - JOFF-ree Buh-RATH-ee-un\n*[[Jon Arryn]] - JON AIR-in\n*[[Jorah Mormont]] - JOR-uh MORE-mont\n*[[Jory Cassel]] - JOR-ee Cuss-EL\n*[[Khal Drogo]] - KHAL DRO-go\n*[[Loras Tyrell]] - LOR-us TI-rul (see Notes below)\n*[[Lysa Arryn]] - LIE-ssa AIR-in\n*[[Luwin|Maester Luwin]] - MAY-ster LOO-win\n*[[Pycelle|Maester Pycelle]] - MAY-ster Py-SELL\n*[[Myrcella Baratheon]] - Mer-SELL-uh Buh-RATH-ee-un\n*[[Nymeria]] - Nigh-MEER-ee-uh\n*[[Petyr Baelish]] - PEE-ter BAY-lish\n*[[Pyp]] - PIP\n*[[Qotho]] - QUO-tho\n*[[Renly Baratheon]] - REN-lee Buh-RATH-ee-un\n*[[Rhaegar Targaryen]] - RAY-gar Tar-GAIR-ee-in\n*[[Rickon Stark]] - RICK-on STARK\n*[[Rodrik Cassel]] - RAH-drick Cuss-EL\n*[[Samwell Tarly]] - SAM-well TAR-lee\n*[[Sandor Clegane]] - SAN-dore Cli-GAIN\n*[[Sansa Stark]] - SAHN-suh STARK\n*[[Mordane|Septa Mordane]] - SEP-ta Mor-DAIN\n*[[Syrio Forel]] - SEER-ee-o For-EL\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]] - THEE-on GRAY-joy\n*[[Tommen Baratheon]] - TAH-min Buh-RATH-ee-un\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]] - TEER-ee-un LAN-iss-ter\n*[[Tywin Lannister]] - TIE-win LAN-iss-ter\n*[[Varys]] - VAIR-iss\n*[[Viserys Targaryen]] - Vi-SAIR-iss Tar-GAIR-ee-in\n*[[Walder Frey]] - WALL-der FRAY\n*[[Waymar Royce]] - WAY-mar ROYCE\n*[[Yoren]] - YOR-in\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Pronunciation guide}} (spoilers from the books) - a more extensive listing, including other important names, and including cited references to how George R.R. Martin or the audio books pronounce them (which ''occasionally'' contradict).\n\n", "Notes": "As the guide notes, &quot;Arya&quot; is pronounced &quot;ARE - yuh&quot;. George R.R. Martin himself has pointed out that a surprisingly large number of people pronounce it incorrectly: it consists of two syllables, not three (like how the &quot;aria&quot; of an opera is pronounced). Martin explained: &quot;I say it 'Are-ya', two syllables not three. Not 'are-ee-uh', not like an operatic thing, but 'Are-ya', very sharp. I wanted something that was like a knife, that was a sharp and hard sound, to be a contrast to the flowery 'Sansa'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtu.be/DOEO27SZAtw?t=3m]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAlso, in [[Season 3]] and [[Season 4]] the pronunciation of &quot;Tyrell&quot; has become notoriously inconsistent: actors have been pronouncing it different ways even within the same scenes, alternating between &quot;TI-rul&quot; and &quot;Tie-rell&quot;.  &quot;Tyrell&quot; is a real life name, however, and in real life there is actually no consistent pronunciation of the name &quot;Tyrell&quot; either.  \n\nAccording to the pronunciation guide, &quot;Qarth&quot; is pronounced &quot;QUARTH&quot;. However, in &quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot; when Daenerys first pronounces it as &quot;Kwarth&quot; she is corrected by the [[Spice King]] that it is actually &quot;KARTH&quot;. The original pronunciation guide may have been in error. Either way, &quot;Karth&quot; is the pronunciation that is actually used on-screen.\n\nThe pronunciation guide states that &quot;''khaleesi''&quot; is pronounced &quot;khal-EE-see&quot;, and this is how characters consistently pronounce it on-screen.  However, professional linguist [[David J. Peterson]], who developed the Dothraki language for the TV series, has frequently remarked that according to the pronunciation rules of Dothraki, the &quot;real&quot; pronunciation should be &quot;KHAH-lay-see&quot;, with the emphasis on the first syllable, not the second syllable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonotactics#Stress ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonology ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Pronunciation guide"}
