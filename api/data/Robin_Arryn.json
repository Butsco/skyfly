He is the [[Lord of the Eyrie]], the head of [[House Arryn]], the [[Warden|Warden of the East]] and [[Lord Paramount]] of the [[Vale of Arryn]]. His mother was killed by\u00c2\u00a0[[Petyr Baelish]]\u00c2\u00a0in &quot;[[Mockingbird]]&quot; by being pushed out of the [[Moon Door]]\u00c2\u00a0and falling hundreds of feet to her death, leaving Petyr as the acting Lord Paramount of the Vale as Robin's step-father.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Robin's character is named '''Robert Arryn'''. The character was renamed for the television series to avoid confusion with Robert Baratheon and Robb Stark - Robb Stark and Robert Arryn both being named after King Robert. The name &quot;Robin&quot; was chosen because it allows him to keep his book nickname of &quot;Sweetrobin&quot;, which is how he is more commonly known. Robert is six years old when the events of the books begin. He is a soft, spoiled child but also sickly, suffering from epileptic seizures which occur sporadically. His mother dotes on him a great deal. His illness, combined with his mother's doting, has left him intellectually and physically stunted for a boy his age.\n\n[[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] used to call Robert cruel names, and once slapped him with a wooden stick.\n\nSansa never harms Robert physically. At one occasion he demands &quot;I want a hundred lemon cakes and five tales!&quot;. Sansa thinks ''&quot;I'd like to give you a hundred spankings and five slaps&quot;'' but restrains herself.\n\nAuthor [[George R.R. Martin]] made it a point to have several characters with the same name, because this happened in real life. It would be implausible to say that &quot;Robert Baratheon&quot; was the only person named &quot;Robert&quot; on an entire continent. Noble families in particular frequently re-use a small set of names, as children are named to honor famous ancestors, relatives, or major allies (i.e. &quot;Robert Arryn&quot; is named in honor of &quot;Robert Baratheon&quot;, his father's great ally, as is Robb Stark). One of the reasons Martin wrote the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels is because he grew so frustrated with writing for television and film, in which budget constraints and audience attention span are a limiting factor. As Martin explained:\n\n:Martin: &quot;I wrote these books, never dreaming they would be filmed or made. It was almost a reaction to my tenure in Hollywood. 'I'm just going to do this as big as I want.' But I broke a lot of rules in writing these books, that you're taught as a writer, that I certainly was taught. But at certain point I thought, 'To hell with those rules'.\n:Question: &quot;What rules?&quot;\n:Martin: &quot;Well, having so many characters, for one. Having similar names. Stuff like that. I remember as a little baby writer I was taught never have two characters whose names begin with the same letter because people will get them confused. And I realized I was going to have more than 26 characters, so that would have to go out the window. - And also I was reading a lot of history. [People said], 'Never have two characters with the same letter? Certainly never have two characters with the same name.' But then I'm saying, 'That's so unrealistic'.\u00c2\u00a0I mean, English history is entirely composed of Henrys and Edwards. There's endless Henrys and Edwards, and you know, not only kings, who at least get numbers, but the guys who never become king. They're princes, and then they die. They're not even distinguished by numbers and it's very hard to keep all these guys straight. But that's the way history actually was. Families using the same name over again. And I like that element of verisimilitude, [so] I adopted that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anders, Charlie Jane.

He presents a list of minor misdemeanors from childhood, though Robin is particularly intrigued by some of them. Tyrion demands a [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] to prove his innocence and persuades the mercenary [[Bronn]] to be his champion.
