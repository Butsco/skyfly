The enmity and competition between [[House Bracken]] and House Blackwood, was radically enhanced when Ser Otho Bracken slew Lord Quentyn Blackwood in a tourney accident roughly a century ago.\n\nThe sigil of House Blackwood is slightly different in the books, in which the white weirwood tree is set against a black escutcheon (shield), which is itself surrounded by a red background containing black ravens. The TV series version removed the black shield, so the white weirwood tree is directly against the red background.\n\n===Members===\n* Lord Tytos Blackwood, the current head of the family.\n**Brynden Blackwood, his eldest son and heir.\n**Lucas Blackwood, his second son.

The Blackwoods hold an ancient grudge against their neighbors, [[House Bracken]] of [[Stone Hedge]]. The two houses, which hold the blood of the [[First Men]] in their veins and merged with the invading [[Andals]] rather than being annihilated by them, competed for the throne of the Riverlands when it was an independent kingdom. The enmity was increased when House Bracken converted to the [[Faith of the Seven]]. House Blackwood, however, is one of the few major noble Houses outside of the North which continues to worship the [[Old Gods of the Forest]], and never converted to the Faith of the Seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/raventree-hall/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Raventree Hall entry]{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n===[[Season 1]]===\nThe banner of House Blackwood is seen at the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "House Blackwood"}
