Davos instructs Gendry to follow a certain star in a straight line, which will allow him to travel due west through open water - instead of just rowing to the closest shore at [[Crackclaw Point]], as this would be his most obvious path of escape. Davos explains that after rowing due west for a full day and night, he will reach Rook's Rest. Davos says he will want to stop there, but he should continue on as Melisandre might still find him unless he goes farther. Davos tells Gendry to instead keep going due west over open water until he reaches the opposite coast, after which he can simply follow the line of the shore south, and he will eventually make his way back to [[King's Landing]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Rook's Rest"}
