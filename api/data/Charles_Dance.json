He was set for a career in graphic design before switching to acting in the 1970s, when he joined the [[wikipedia:Royal Shakespeare Company|Royal Shakespeare Company]]. His television breakthrough came in the 1984 series ''[[wikipedia:The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]''.\n\nIn the United States, Dance became best known for playing villains, most notably in the films ''[[wikipedia:The Golden Child|The Golden Child]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Last Action Hero|Last Action Hero]]'' (where he acted against [[wikipedia:Eddie Murphy|Eddie Murphy]] and [[wikipedia:Arnold Schwarznegger|Arnold Schwarznegger]] respectively). He also played a henchmen of the main villain in the ''[[wikipedia:James Bond|James Bond]]'' movie ''[[wikipedia:For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', where he met and acted alongside fellow ''Thrones'' actor [[Julian Glover]]. He also acted in 2011 in the medieval drama ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironclad_(film) Ironclad]\u00c2\u00a0''as Archbishop Langton. Dance also had a rare &quot;good guy&quot; Hollywood role as Dr. Clemens in ''[[wikipedia:Alien 3|Alien 3]]''. One of Charles Dance's more prominent film roles was as Soames, the MI5 agent who commanded the Cairo Gang during the Irish War of Independence, in the 1996 film ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_%28film%29 Michael Collins].''\n\nDance's most recent television appearances were as the Witchfinder in an episode of ''[[wikipedia:Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'', as [[wikipedia:Havelock Vetinari|Havelock Vetinari]] in the Sky adaptation of ''[[wikipedia:Terry Pratchett's Going Postal|Going Postal]]'' and as Dr. Maltravers in the ITV drama ''[[wikipedia:Trinity (TV series)|Trinity]]''.\n\n", "See also": "*{{Template:WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = nm0001097}}\n[[de:Charles Dance]]\n\n", "Game of Thrones": "\nIn ''[[Game of Thrones]],''\u00c2\u00a0Dance plays Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. He was confirmed in the role on 29 July 2010. He initially appeared as a guest star in the [[Season 1|first season]] and joined the starring cast for the [[Season 2|second season]].  Dance first caught Benioff and Weiss's eyes for the role when they saw his work in ''Bleak House''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/game-of-thrones/243771/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4 ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTywin is actually 58 years old when he dies, but in the corresponding section of Season 4, Tywin is said to be 67 years old in the TV series.  This was probably done to match Dance's age.  Also, while the name of Tywin's wife was [[Joanna Lannister]], Dance also had a wife named Joanna.\n\nDance never read any of the books, through his exit from the show at the end of Season 4.  He was also made aware of his character's death from a fan encounter - not that he is entirely innocent of being spoiled about it.  As he explained, a fan greeted him once and complimented that Tywin has a great death scene in the novels - he didn't say what it was, but Dance was so intrigued that he went ahead and asked him what was the specific manner of his death.  Before that point he wasn't even aware that Tywin would die before the TV series ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/new-blu-ray-video-extra-game-of-thrones-fallen-roundtable/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Charles Dance"}
