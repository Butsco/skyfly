She will be played by [[Elizabeth Cadwallader]]. Lollys is a noble lady and second in line for the inheritance of [[Castle Stokeworth]]. She is considered dim-witted.\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Stokeworth family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, her background remains the same. However, she is a fairly regular background character during the course of the first three books. She is morbidly obese and is considered [[lackwit|simple]]. In addition, she is second in line for the inheritance of House Stokeworth's lands and titles, so there are no suitors for her hand; her mother, Lady Tanda, is desperate to find a match for her, even relentlessly pursuing Tyrion for a time.\n\nLollys is a victim in the [[Riot of King's Landing]], where she is ambushed and gang-raped by fifty men in [[Flea Bottom]], which results in her pregnancy with a [[ bastard]] child. After this, she is considered defiled and is left a social pariah at court. This makes her an ideal match for Bronn, who as an &quot;upjumped cutthroat&quot; is also considered too low for suitable noble matches, yet now their circumstances have met in the middle.\n\n[[Shae]], while acting as secret mistress to Tyrion during his stint as Hand of the King, served a time as hand-maiden to Lollys, before coming into [[Sansa Stark]]'s service following her marriage to Tyrion.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Lollys stays with her mother and sister in the [[Red Keep]]. They are invited by [[Cersei Lannister]] to seek refuge with her in the Queen's Ballroom at [[Maegor's Holdfast]]. When they are about to cross the drawbridge, Lollys becomes frightened and refuses to cross, clutches at [[Shae]] and sobbing, &quot;I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to.&quot; Sansa notices that Shae looks as if she wants to shove Lollys into the dry moat, onto the iron spikes. Sansa speaks softly to Lollys and tries to calm her, but to no avail. Finally, Shae and Falyse grab Lollys by her elbows, and drag her across the bridge. Sansa feels sorry for Lollys, knowing about her rape and pregnancy.\n\n", "Biography": "===[[Season 4]]===\n\n[[Cersei Lannister]] arranges for a marriage between Lollys and Ser [[Bronn]] of the Blackwater, to sway the ambitious ex-[[Mercenary|sellsword]] from [[Tyrion Lannister]]'s service. Though her older sister, [[Falyse Stokeworth|Falyse]], is heir to [[Castle Stokeworth]], she is forty years old and barren, and Bronn suggests to Tyrion that she may suffer an &quot;accident&quot; in time, making Lollys the sole heir.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mockingbird]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Lollys Stokeworth}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Lollys Stokeworth"}
