Its female equivalent is '''Princess'''.\n\nThe title usually includes all of the children of a monarch. If a king is newly established (through conquest, usurpation, or declaring independence) his children will become princes, but it is variable if his brothers become princes. For example, after [[Robert Baratheon]] usurped the crown, his younger brothers remained as &quot;Lords&quot; but not &quot;Princes&quot;. In contrast, when [[Robb Stark]] declared [[the North]] an independent kingdom again, he and his followers considered all of his younger siblings to be &quot;Princes&quot; and &quot;Princesses&quot;.\n\n", "Princes of Dorne": "\n:''See main article &quot;[[Prince of Dorne]]&quot;''\n\n[[House Martell]] still rule [[Dorne]] as Princes. The head of the family holds the title of [[Prince of Dorne]] - or Princess in case of female rulers - while the rest of the family hold the titles of Prince or Princess.\n\nWhile the title &quot;Prince&quot; in other parts of the Seven Kingdoms is typically used to indicate the heir to the throne, Dorne has Ruling Princes (or Ruling Princesses). This is a holdover from centuries ago when the [[Rhoynar]] ruled city-states along the [[Rhoyne]] River in Essos. Dorne had a Ruling Prince when it was an independent kingdom, and only unified with the Targaryen realm one century ago - not through conquest but through marriage-alliance. As a result of this voluntary union, the Martell rulers of Dorne were allowed to continue to style themselves as &quot;Princes&quot; even though they are no longer the absolute sovereign.\n\n===Martell Princes and Princesses===\n* Prince [[Doran Martell]], the ruling Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear\n* Prince [[Trystane Martell]], the youngest son of Prince Doran.\n* Prince {[[Oberyn Martell]]}, Prince Doran's younger brother.\n\n"}, "title": "Prince"}
