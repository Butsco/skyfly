He is played by guest star [[Dar Salim]] and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming (episode)|series premiere]]. Qotho is a [[bloodrider]] to Khal [[Drogo]]. He is killed by [[Jorah Mormont]] after Drogo falls ill. Qotho tries to prevent [[Mirri Maz Duur]] from treating Drogo and Jorah intervenes.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Qotho is a skilled warrior, but he is also considered to be cruel and malicious, the least-likable of Drogo's three bloodriders.\n\nIn the books, Drogo's three bloodriders are Qotho, Cohollo, and Haggo. All three attempt to intervene when Mirri Maz Duur conducts her ritual to heal Drogo, and all three are killed in the resulting fight. Qotho was personally killed by Jorah, just as in the TV series. Unidentified extras fill in some of the actions carried out by Cohollo and Haggo but do not take part in the fight with Ser Jorah, so all three have been functionally condensed into Qotho.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nGoldencrown.png|Qotho restrains [[Viserys Targaryen]] as [[Drogo]] kills him in &quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;.\nDrogo's fall.jpg|Qotho looks on as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] tends to the injured [[Drogo]] after he falls from his horse in &quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;.\nGreat Shepherd Altar.png|Qotho an altar of the [[Great Shepherd]] in Lhazar.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season One Appearances|yes|yes|no|no|no|yes|yes|yes|yes}}\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nQotho is a [[Dothraki]] [[bloodrider]] in the service of [[Khal Drogo]].
