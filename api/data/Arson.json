He is long dead when the series begins.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Arson Iceaxe was a legendary wildling raider who tried to cross [[the Wall]] by digging through it's base. When he was midway under the ice, he was discovered by a patrol from the [[Nightfort]]. Instead of trying to stop the wildling, they decided to wall him in alive. The legend says that by pressing the ear against the Wall, one can still hear the sound of Arson's axe digging away at the ice. Since this time, the [[Night's Watch]] sends infrequent patrols along the base of the Wall on it's northern face to look for traces of excavation.\n\n", "Biography": "According to legend, Arson attempted to cut through [[the Wall]] with his axe. He had almost cut halfway through by the time the [[Night's Watch]] discovered him. Instead of stopping him, they trapped him inside by sealing the way behind him with ice, stone and snow. Some believe that if one presses their ear flat to the Wall, they will be able to hear him chipping away inside.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wall (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Arson"}
