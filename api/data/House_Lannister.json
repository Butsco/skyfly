As a result it has produced numerous cadet branches and distant cousins of the main line, who have prospered as members of the minor nobility in the Westerlands for many years. In contrast, while [[House Stark]] is even older than House Lannister, due to the harsh conditions of the North (both low economic output and threat of Wildling attacks) by the time of the [[War of the Five Kings]], the Starks possess few if any cousins, and only one major cadet branch, [[House Karstark]]. Therefore, there are numerous minor members of the extended &quot;House Lannister&quot; which exist in the background of the narrative, but they are so numerous and distantly related that members of the main line wouldn't think to mention them any more than they would their other vassals.\n\n*Ser {[[Alton Lannister]]} - a cousin to Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion from a lesser branch of the family. A prisoner of House Stark. Killed by Jaime as part of an escape attempt.

The major characters [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and the recurring characters [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], and [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] are members of the house. Tywin is the head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock.\n\nTheir lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is [[Casterly Rock]], a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the [[Westerlands]] and Wardens of the West. House Lannister's [[Heraldry]] consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their [[House words]] are '''&quot;Hear me roar!&quot;''', which is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, is '''&quot;A Lannister always pays his debts&quot;''' - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.\n\nThe [[Incest|incestuous]] relationship of Cersei and Jaime has been concealed in a conspiracy. Their son [[Joffrey Baratheon]] has claimed the Iron Throne on the premise that he was actually fathered by the late King [[Robert Baratheon]]. Lord Tywin is a key supporter of his reign in the [[War of the Five Kings]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Lannister was established many thousands of years prior to the books' opening by a trickster-hero called Lann the Clever, who tricked the powerful Casterly family into abandoning their stronghold of [[Casterly Rock]], which the Lannisters took for their own. The Lannisters have ruled the region known as the Westerlands ever since, getting rich off the many gold and silver mines in the western hills and mountains.\n\nDuring [[Robert's Rebellion]], the Lannisters sat out most of the war, refusing to heed the calls of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] to aid him in crushing the rebellion. After the rebel victory at the [[Battle of the Trident]], the Lannister army marched to the relief of [[King's Landing]] but, instead of helping defend the city, they brutally sacked it, killing King Aerys and his grandchildren. Robert Baratheon publicly forgave the Lannisters their actions and accepted their allegiance, marrying Cersei Lannister in thanks for Tywin's assistance. However, [[Eddard Stark]] saw the Lannister action as betrayal and murder, and has not trusted them ever since.\n\nHouse Lannister consists of a &quot;main&quot; branch led by Lord Tywin and a junior branch, led by cousins, that controls the city of Lannisport. The Lannisters are a relatively large family, though nowhere near as numerous as the [[House Frey|Freys of the Crossing]].\n\nA minor change is that in the books the heraldry of House Lannister features a lion passant (striding on all four legs), but in the TV series the lion is rampant (rearing up with its forepaws raised to attack). The variant with the striding, passant lion is still glimpsed on several occasions in the TV series (i.e. Tywin's battle-flags during the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]), though it is not the primary version featured in promotional materials.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Lannister&quot; is pronounced &quot;LAN-iss-ter&quot;. It rhymes with &quot;Lancaster&quot;. The conflict between the &quot;Starks and Lannisters&quot; in the series is loosely inspired by the English War of the Roses between the &quot;Yorks and Lancasters&quot;.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nHouse Lannister tourney.jpg|The banner of House Lannister at the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]] in &quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;.\nHouse Lannister.jpg|The sigil of House Lannister from the Maester's Path promotional campaign.\nLannister icon.png|Icon for House Lannister from the HBO viewer's guide.\nLannister Shield.jpg|A shield emblazoned with the sigil of House Lannister from the HBO viewer's guide.\nLannister-small.png|Small icon of House Lannister from the HBO viewers guide.\nLannistersEW.png|Tyrion, Jaime, and Cersei Lannister in a promotional image from Entertainment Weekly.\nLannister Map-marker.jpg|A map-marker used to represent House Lannister forces.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nHouse Lannister is one of the [[Great Houses]] of [[Westeros]].

His father [[Tytos Lannister]] presided over a period of decline for the house. He frittered away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowed himself to be mocked at court creating a perception of weakness. Their vassals [[House Reyne]] of [[Castamere]] [[Reyne Rebellion|rebelled]] against Lord Tytos. Tywin put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister.

Robert plans to make [[Eddard Stark]] Hand of the King. They are accompanied by their brother [[Tyrion Lannister]]. Their son [[Joffrey Baratheon]] is betrothed to [[Sansa Stark]]. Cersei and Jaime continue liaise in a disused tower. They are interrupted by [[Bran Stark]] and Jaime pushes him out of the window of the tower to prevent him revealing what he saw.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Winter is Coming&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei and Jaime are shocked to learn that Bran survived the fall. Cersei visits Catelyn at Bran's bedside and tells her that she once had a black haired son who died young. Joffrey refuses to pay the Stark family the same courtesy and Tyrion violently rebukes him. The royal party leaves Winterfell and Tyrion splits from the group to go further north to see [[the Wall]]. He befriends [[Jon Snow]], a bastard of [[House Stark]] and new volunteer to the Night's Watch. On the Kingsroad south Joffrey is attacked by [[Arya Stark]] and her direwolf [[Nymeria]]. He claims that the attack was unprovoked. When the direwolf cannot be found Cersei demands that its sister wolf [[Lady]] be executed. An assassin attempts to kill Bran as he lies comatose at Winterfell but he is protected by his direwolf [[Summer]]. Catelyn discovers a blond hair in the disused tower and notes the fine blade the assassin used; she suspects the Lannisters of ordering the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei counsels her son about the incident and warns him that anyone who is not a member of their House is an enemy. A raven arrives with news of Bran's recovery. Cersei fears that he will expose their secret and Jaime comforts her. Tyrion finds the Night's Watch undermanned and lacking voluntary recruits. He travels south with the recruiter [[Yoren]]. Catelyn goes to King's Landing to discuss the attack on Bran with Eddard. She is told by [[Petyr Baelish]] that the knife the assassin used belonged to Tyrion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion is disturbed by a frosty reception from [[Robb Stark]] at Winterfell and notes the absence of Catelyn. He delivers plans for a saddle that will allow the paraplegic Bran to ride a horse but chooses to stay elsewhere because of Robb's rudeness. Much further south Tyrion chances across Catelyn in the Inn at the Crossroads. She calls upon the loyalty of the Tully bannermen present and has him arrested for the assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn King's Landing Eddard begins to investigate the movements of [[Jon Arryn]] prior to his death and uncovers a bastard son of Robert. Jaime refuses to deliver a message from Eddard to Robert but does reminisce with Eddard's Captain [[Jory Cassel]] about fighting during the Greyjoy Rebellion. Jaime is chagrined at having to guard Robert while he cheats on Cersei. Cersei attends the Tourney of the Hand thrown in Robert's honor but leaves when Robert's coarse behaviour annoys her. She visits Eddard, questions his motivations and warns him that his service to Robert is futile. Lannister sworn sword [[Gregor Clegane]] kills Jon Arryn's former squire [[Hugh]] of the Vale during the jousts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei and Robert have a frank discussion about the threat of the alliance between the exiled [[House Targaryen]] and the [[Dothraki]], their loveless marriage, and Robert's feelings for his dead first love [[Lyanna Stark]]. Catelyn takes Tyrion East through the Vale of Arryn and he is imprisoned in the sky cells of the Eyrie. News of his capture reaches King's Landing and Jaime confronts Eddard and kills several of his guards, including Jory before duelling him personally. Eddard is wounded by a Lannister Man-at-Arms and Jaime leaves him alive and rides out of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] calls his banners and marches on the Riverlands (Catelyn's ancestral home) to punish her for Tyrion's abduction.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCersei and Robert argue over punishing Eddard for the capture of Tyrion and Robert hits her. Robert goes hunting in the Kingswood leaving Eddard to rule in his absence. Refugees from the Riverlands report being attacked by Ser Gregor Clegane. Eddard dispatches a small force to bring Gregor to justice and calls Tywin to King's Landing to answer for Gregor's crimes. Tyrion wins his freedom in a trial by combat where the sellsword [[Bronn]] fights as his champion. Eddard's investigation leads him to realise that Cersei's children are all fathered by Jaime.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nJaime liaises with Tywin's forces at an encampment in the Riverlands. Tywin has gathered an army of sixty thousand men. He tells Jaime that the current conflict will decide the fate of their family. He orders Jaime to take thirty thousand men and besiege [[Riverrun]], Catelyn's childhood home and the seat of [[House Tully]]. Jaime ponders why Tywin would risk so much for the ugly, stunted son that he hates, and Tywin explains that a Lannister is a Lannister and any affront must be punished.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You Win or You Die&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEddard confronts Cersei with his findings and warns her that he intends to tell Robert on his return. Robert's squire [[Lancel Lannister]] gives him plenty to drink during the hunt and Robert is gravely wounded by a boar in the Kingswood. He is brought back to King's Landing to die. Eddard holds his tongue and Robert declares him Protector of the Realm from his deathbed. [[Renly Baratheon]] appeals to Eddard to help him seize the throne but Eddard refuses because [[Stannis Baratheon]] is Robert's oldest brother and rightful heir. Eddard writes to Stannis to inform him of his findings and then recruits Baelish and the City Watch in an attempt to take Cersei and her children into custody. Renly flees the city. Eddard is betrayed by his allies and she instead has him arrested and destroys Robert's final proclamation. Cersei installs Joffrey as King and becomes Queen Regent.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You Win or You Die&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLannister forces massacre the remaining Stark retainers in King's Landing. Sansa is captured but Arya escapes. Cersei manipulates Sansa into writing to her brother Robb to convince him to swear fealty to Joffrey. Robb sees through the ploy and calls his banners to march south. Cersei dismisses Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] as [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Kingsguard]] and installs Jaime in his place.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion is captured by the [[Hill tribes]] of the Vale but convinces them to join the Lannister cause in exchange for weapons and autonomy from the Lord of the Eyrie.
