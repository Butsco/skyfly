It is an attack on populated areas with the purpose of seizing weaponry, food, gold, or prisoners.\n\nIt forms the basis of the economies of the [[Free Folk]]\u00c2\u00a0[[beyond the Wall]] of [[Westeros]] and the [[Dothraki]] in central and western [[Essos]].\n\n[[Ironborn]] also engage in raiding traditionally, though in their case raiding is also a [[Drowned God|religious]] activity.

This rebellion is known as the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. It ultimately ended in [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoy]] defeat, cementing the rule of King [[Robert\u00c2\u00a0Baratheon|Robert&amp;nbsp;Baratheon]], and resulting in Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s [[Theon Greyjoy|only surviving son and heir]] becoming a [[ward]] of [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]].\n\nIn times of war, factions also engage in raiding to deprive the enemy of resources.\n\n"}, "title": "Raiding"}
