Every religion either has a god of death (in polytheistic faiths), or worships a single god with dominion over death (in monotheistic faiths). Incarnations of the Many-Faced God of Death would include\u00c2\u00a0[[The Stranger|the Stranger]] in the [[Faith of the Seven]], that has dominion over death, and the [[Great Other]] opponent of [[R'hllor]].\n\nThere seems to be some confusion in the TV series between the God of Death and [[R'hllor]], the Red God. It stems from a piece of dialogue spoken by [[Jaqen H'ghar]], both in the books and in the television show, in which he refers to the god he worships (presumably the God of Death, as he is a Faceless Man) as the &quot;Red God&quot; \u00e2&euro;&rdquo;that is,\u00c2\u00a0R'hllor. Later, solely in the show, the words &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot; and &quot;Valar Dohaeris&quot;, which in the books are used by Faceless Men, are used once between worshipers of R'hllor. While this confusion has yet to be cleared up, a likely explanation lies in the fact that the &quot;Many-faced God of Death&quot; is a syncretic religion, which holds that every god or set of gods is just another facet of the god of death.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Syrio Forel]] mentions his belief in the God of Death to [[Arya Stark]] during their &quot;[[Water Dance|dancing]]&quot; lessons.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\n\nArya Stark reveals to [[Beric Dondarrion]]\u00c2\u00a0and [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]] that she has come to believe that &quot;Death&quot; is the one true god.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Many-Faced God"}
