But the comet means one thing, boy. Dragons.|[[Osha]]|The North Remembers}}\nThe '''Red Comet''', also called the '''Red Messenger''' or '''Red Sword''', is an astronomical phenomenon. It appeared in the skies over both [[Westeros]] and [[Essos]] shortly after the outbreak of the [[War of the Five Kings]] and the hatching of the [[dragons]] of [[Daenerys Targaryen]].\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the Books": "\nIn the books, the Red Comet is seen throughout the known world and interpreted in different manners by different people. Some see it as harbinger of their victory - or the enemy's - in the War of the Five Kings or as an omen of vengeance, while to many more it signifies the onset of war and the bloodshed that's to come. The Comet is also interpreted by [[Daenerys]] as a sign that she must venture into the [[Red Waste]]. Old Nan was the only character to interpret it as dragons.\n\nIt also receives different names. In [[King's Landing]] it is referred to as &quot;King [[Joffrey]]'s comet&quot; at court and the &quot;Red Messenger&quot; in the streets. Soldiers in [[the Riverlands]] also call it the Red Messenger. The members of the [[Night's Watch]] that take part in the [[Great Ranging]] refer to it as &quot;Mormont's Torch&quot;, while [[Gendry]] calls it the &quot;Red Sword&quot; on account of its shape. The [[Dothraki]] of Daenerys' [[khalasar]] call it &quot;shierak qiya&quot;, meaning &quot;bleeding star&quot;.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\nThe Red Comet was seen in the skies over most of the two continents. Its significance is discussed by the people of [[Winterfell]], who seem divided on it being an omen of King [[Robb Stark]]'s victory or if its red color indicates a triumph for the forces of [[House Lannister]] while others consider the red color to represent the blood of [[Eddard Stark]]. However, the [[wildling]] woman [[Osha]] dismisses all of these suggestions: she maintains that the comet means that there are [[dragons]] again.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Red Comet"}
