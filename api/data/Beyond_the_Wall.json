The region immediately north of the Wall includes the [[Haunted Forest]], a vast taiga-forest which covers most of the area, extending from the Wall to the furthest uncharted north.\n\nThe forest extends from the eastern coast to a large mountain chain in the west known as the [[Frostfangs]]. The Frostfangs extend an unknown distance to the north and are quite inhospitable. However, there are rumors that even the northern Frostfangs contain hidden valleys, heated by volcanic activity, which are actually the most hospitable regions north of the Wall, and heavily settled by the wildlings.\n\nSouthwest of the Frostfangs there is a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the sea known as the [[Frozen Shore]], a harsh area inhabited by fierce and primitive warriors who frequently cross the [[Bay of Ice]] to raid the lands in [[the North]] sworn to [[House Stark]]. This small area is totally enclosed by the Frostfangs, which run southeast to northwest, and the ocean.\n\nBeyond all of these areas, in the furthest north are the [[Lands of Always Winter]]. The forest ends and gives way to these truly polar regions, which are unexplored. The [[White Walkers]] are rumored to originate in the depths of the Lands of Always Winter.\n\n", "TOP": "Beyond the Wall06368qfr1nzafnmhtu199coox39z3mt993gh1759362015-03-09T02:40:29ZThe Dragon Demands5014364{{Region\n| Title=Beyond the Wall\n| Image=Beyond the Wall.png\n| Location=[[Westeros]]\n| Formerly=\n| Type=Geographic area\n| Geography=Sub-arctic taiga forest (east)&lt;br&gt;freezing mountains and glaciers (west),&lt;br&gt; subarctic tundra, to uninhabitable polar waste (extreme north)\n| Population=[[Wildling|Free Folk]]&lt;br/&gt;[[White Walkers]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Giants]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Children of the Forest]]\n| Rulers= Usually various factions and tribes, occasionally united by an over-chief known as the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]].\n| Religion=The [[Old Gods of the Forest]]\n| Culture=[[Free Folk]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Giants]]&lt;br/&gt;[[White Walkers|White Walker]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Children of the Forest]]\n| Military=\n| Regional capital=\n| Cities=\n| Towns=\n| Villages=[[White Tree]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Cave of the three-eyed raven]]\n| Castles=[[Craster's Keep]]\n| Places=[[Fist of the First Men]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Frostfangs]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Frozen Shore]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Haunted Forest]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Lands of Always Winter]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Skirling Pass]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Milkwater]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 Valley of [[Thenn]] \u00e2&euro;\u02d8 [[Storrold's Point]]\n| Founding=\n| Age=\n| Founder=}}\n{{Quote|We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.|[[Mance Rayder]]|Valar Dohaeris}}\n[[File:The Wall.jpg|thumb|300px|The north side of the Wall.]]'''Beyond the Wall''' is a generic term employed by the people of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] to refer to the large area of [[Westeros]] that lies north of [[the Wall]]. It is the only part of the continent that is not part of the realm, and thus the only place where particular attention is given to the difference between &quot;Westeros&quot; (the continent), and &quot;the Seven Kingdoms&quot; (the realm to the south of the Wall ruled by the [[Iron Throne]]).\n\nIt is inhabited by tribes that refer to themselves as the &quot;[[Free Folk]]&quot;, known by the people of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] as '''wildlings'''. The wildlings themselves are not politically unified but consist of numerous and diverse groups. Many are semi-nomadic hunters, due to the impracticality of agriculture in the far north. Some wildlings are little more than savage and primitive raiders, but other groups live in small settled communities and villages.\n\nThe Free Folk sometimes refer to these lands as &quot;the real North&quot;, because they are actually located north of the northernmost of the Seven Kingdoms, which is named simply &quot;[[The North]]&quot; - and they think it odd to say that &quot;the north&quot; is ''south'' of where they live.  \n\n", "In the books": "\nAuthor [[George R.R. Martin]] has stated that the land-area inhabited by the Free Folk beyond the Wall is vast, roughly the size of Canada: &quot;There's actually quite a lot of Westeros north of the Wall, it's a large expanse of land, probably as large as Canada.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/03/new-s3-video-inside-the-wildlings/ HBO Behind-the-scenes featurette], Game of Thrones Season 3: Inside the Wildlings&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n''The World of Ice and Fire'' companion book features a map of Westeros and western Essos that shows a significant amount of land north of the Wall, possibly extending further east and west as well, backing up the suggestion that the lands beyond the Wall are vast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://24.media.tumblr.com/ddd579fdf10fb72658d43f003dd62bb4/tumblr_n5igo1nnHW1sybxk4o3_1280.png ''The World of Ice and Fire'' preview]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", " Notable locations ": "*[[Haunted Forest]]\n** [[Craster's Keep]]\n** [[White Tree]]\n* The [[Fist of the First Men]]\n* The [[Frostfangs]]\n** [[Skirling Pass]]\n* The [[Milkwater]]\n* [[Lands of Always Winter]]\n* [[Frozen Shore]]\n* [[Storrold's Point]]\n* The Valley of [[Thenn]]\n* \u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;The [[Cave of the three-eyed raven]]\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n* [http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/map/ HBO Viewer's Guide.]\n\n", "Economy": "\nThe [[Free Folk]] living north of [[The Wall]] have a hardscrabble, survival-based economy, with little settled agriculture. Most of their economic activity is fixated on hunting and gathering: they live to catch what they can eat, and they eat whatever they can catch. They use no official [[currency]], as they are more interested in obtaining things that are directly useful to them, and thus function on the barter system.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, the wildlings do engage in at least some long-distance trade: the heavy furs of local animals adapted to the harsh cold of the extreme north are fairly valuable, and they often trade them to passing smuggler ships in exchange for iron weapons, which they cannot forge on their own. In past centuries the Night's Watch tried to stop the fur-for-iron trade along the coasts, but in recent centuries as their numbers dwindled they abandoned any attempts to prevent passage around the Wall by sea.\n\n", "Notable inhabitants": "* [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], leader of the Free Folk and feared opponent of the Night's Watch.
