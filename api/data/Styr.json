Unlike the other wildling clans, the Thenn actually have lords (more like hereditary chieftains), and live under established laws that they enforce. As a result they are the most disciplined of the wildling clans, making them organized and dangerous in combat; they also possess the most advanced armor and weaponry among the Free Folk. The Magnar's followers worship the man like a god, and follow every order, however ridiculous.\n\nIn the series, much of his plotline from ''A Storm of Swords'' is taken by [[Tormund Giantsbane]] - including being mistaken by [[Jon Snow]] for Mance, and leading the climb over [[the Wall]]. He is described as a tall lean man with no ears, clean shaven, bald with a straight nose and grey eyes. He doesn't speak the [[Common Tongue]], speaking only the [[Old Tongue]].\n\nStyr is also not a cannibal, and doesn't possess scars on his head.\n\nStyr is not killed by Jon in personal combat. During the [[Battle of Castle Black]] he leads the majority of the Thenns to mount the stair and push back the crumbling defense, killing some of the brothers and villagers.  Because Jon warned the Watch of their approach, the garrison knew they were coming and sprung a trap: the stair, soaked in oil between the last Watch line of defense and the base of the structure, is set ablaze, destroying the stair and killing Styr and most of his men.\n\nStyr is succeeded by his son Sigorn as the Magnar of Thenn.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "Dutch actor [[wikipedia:Yorick van Wageningen|Yorick van Wageningen]] auditioned for the role of Styr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/05/14/leaked-audition-video-means-season-4-casting-underway/]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season Four Appearances|yes||yes|||||yes|yes}}\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nStyr is the Magnar of the Thenn, a fierce tribe of [[Free Folk]] known for their practice of ritual self-scarification and engaging in cannibalism of their fallen enemies. Styr is a very highly-skilled warrior and is capable of wielding a great axe with ease due to his size and strength.\n\nAt some point, Mance Rayder convinced Styr\u00c2\u00a0to join his army and acknowledge him as the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]. Styr became one of Mance's lieutenants, along chieftains such as [[Tormund Giantsbane]] and the [[Lord of Bones]].\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\n[[File:Thenn.jpg|thumb|Styr meets Tormund.]]\nStyr\u00c2\u00a0leads a group of Thenns towards\u00c2\u00a0[[Castle Black]] and encounters [[Tormund]] and [[Ygritte]] after the [[Thenn Warg|warg]] in his group sees them through the eyes of his owl. Styr mocks them over the death of [[Orell]] and their failure to kill [[Jon Snow]]. Afterwards, he and his fellow Thenns prepare to eat a member of the [[Night's Watch]] whom they have recently killed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nStyr, Tormund,\u00c2\u00a0Ygritte and other wildlings\u00c2\u00a0attack a village killing all of its residents, save for [[Olly|one child]]. Styr orders this child to run to [[Castle Black]] to warn the Night's Watch about the wildlings. Before this, he informs the child that he is going to eat his dead parents.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nStyr and Tormund attack the settlement of [[Mole's Town]]. They slaughter most of the inhabitants, which include members of the Night's Watch who were visiting the local brothel. News of this attack reaches Castle Black, which is their next target.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:StyrDeath.PNG|thumb|left|222px|Styr is killed by Jon Snow.]]\nJust outside of Castle Black, Styr chastises Ygritte for not killing Jon Snow when she had the chance. Soon after, his [[Thenn Warg|warg]] has spotted Mance Rayder's signal and they attack Castle Black. During the battle, he kills numerous black brothers before spotting Jon Snow. In the midst of the fighting, Styr and Jon duel each other in the courtyard of Castle Black. Styr gets the upper hand by knocking away [[Longclaw]] from Jon and fighting hand to hand. He forces Jon's head into a blacksmith anvil, however, Jon eventually distracts him by spitting in his face and literally smashes Styr's head in with a hammer, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Watchers on the Wall]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nAfter the arrival of [[Stannis Baratheon]] and his army, Jon enters the chambers where Tormund is being held and mentions that the bodies of the fallen wildlings are going to be burned.\u00c2\u00a0Styr's body is burned along with the other wildlings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Children]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Styr"}
