Their lands are located on the island of [[The Arbor]], southwest of Highgarden. Its [[heraldry]] consists of a burgundy grape cluster on a white field.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Redwyne is a one of the most powerful noble families in [[the Reach]], with close ties to their overlords House Tyrell. The large offshore island they rule, The Arbor, is famous as the home of the largest vineyards in Westeros. A large portion of the wines exported across [[Westeros]] come from the Arbor, and the higher-quality wines produced on the Arbor are considered to be the best in Westeros. Due to their island location and heavy involvement in the wine trade, House Redwyne maintains a large fleet of ships. The Redwyne fleet forms a significant portion of the fleet of the Reach, of which Lord Paxter Redwyne serves as high admiral and commander.\n\nMembers of House Redwyne tend to have bright orange hair.\n\nWhile most vassal Houses from the Reach joined House Tyrell in fighting for the royal [[House Targaryen]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]], the Redwynes are noted for being particularly staunch Targaryen-loyalists.\n\nThe Season 2 Blu-ray special features display the Redwyne sigil under a list of Renly Baratheon's supporters, but in the books House Redwyne doesn't declare for Renly. They wanted to, but during the early stages of the [[War of the Five Kings]] Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] holds the twin sons of Lord Paxter hostage at the royal court. After Renly dies, they join their Tyrell liege lords in aiding the Lannister army in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].\n\nA slight difference is that the sigil of House Redwyne in the books is a burgundy grape cluster on a blue field, but the TV series changed this to a burgundy grape cluster on a white field, probably because burgundy on blue is more difficult to readily distinguish.\n\n'''Members'''\n*Lord [[Paxter Redwyne]], Lord of the Arbor.\n**Mina Tyrell, his wife and first cousin.
