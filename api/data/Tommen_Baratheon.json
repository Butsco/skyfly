Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.|Tyrion Lannister|Breaker of Chains}}\n'''Tommen Baratheon''' is a major character in the [[Season 5|fifth]] season. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the [[Season 1|first]], [[Season 2|second]] and [[Season 4|fourth]] seasons. He is portrayed by guest star [[Dean-Charles Chapman]], taking over the role (starting in Season 4) from [[Callum Wharry]], who played the character briefly in Seasons 1 and 2. Tommen is the younger brother of late [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey]] and [[Myrcella Baratheon|Princess Myrcella]], and Joffrey's heir presumptive to the [[Iron Throne]]. Though legally the son of the late King\u00c2\u00a0[[Robert Baratheon]] and Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], his true father is Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], the Queen's twin brother.\n\nFollowing Joffrey's death at his [[Purple Wedding|wedding feast]], Tommen is crowned [[King of the Andals and the First Men|King]]. His formal style is '''Tommen of the House Baratheon, [[King of the Andals and the First Men|First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms]]'''. As he is not old enough to rule in his own right and command the military forces of the Seven Kingdoms, he does not yet bear the title of [[Protector of the Realm]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tommen is seven years old when the events of the books begin. He is a gentle boy with an interest in [[tournament]]s and kittens. He is blonde haired, green eyed, plump, and not very good at martial skills (though he is very young), but he does try hard. When the royal party visits Winterfell, he is matched against [[Bran Stark]] in a training fight with wooden swords and padding. He is repeatedly knocked into the mud and loses easily, but shows good sportsmanship about it and is happy that Bran was willing to spar with him so he could give it a try. Many characters believe he would be a better king than his brother.\n\nLike all of Cersei's children he was mostly ignored by King Robert. While Cersei felt she doted on all of her children, she is more attached to her own mental constructs of them than the reality. As Cersei's loveless marriage with Robert dragged on year after year, she increasingly fantasized about how Joffrey would one day succeed Robert and become a great king himself, never acknowledging that he was really a petulant sociopath. Ironically, despite Cersei's defiant claims (and even earnest belief) that she is a devoted mother to all of her children, she actually became so obsessed with Joffrey (and her fantasies about him) that she ''all but ignored'' Myrcella and Tommen throughout their lives. From the moment she gave birth to Joffrey, Cersei dreamed about the great king he would grow into, and how as Jaime's secret son he would be her ultimate revenge on Robert: the births of her two subsequent children were barely an anecdote in the narrative of this mental fantasy which has already been established in her mind years before. Her younger children were pushed off to the side, and with Robert a non-factor in their lives as well, they were functionally raised by court servants, such as Septa [[Eglantine]]. Even so, Cersei will still become hypocritically enraged when anyone questions her relationship with her younger children.\n\nTV viewers who haven't read the books may find it odd that while the children of the current generation of House Stark are given a large amount of screentime, the younger children of the current generation of House Lannister barely appear at all. This is much as it was in the earlier books of the series, and is actually a key plot point: the almost total absence of Myrcella and Tommen from the inner dynamics of House Lannister is indicative of just how little importance they have to Cersei. People are aware they exist, but rarely even pause to consider treating them as individuals with their own emotions or agendas (between the two of them, they had only a ''single'' throwaway speaking line in the entire first season, &quot;is Bran going to die?&quot; - [[Rickon Stark]] had more dialogue in Season 1 than both of them combined). At best, Cersei will argue over their treatment on general principle, such as when she opposed &quot;selling&quot; Myrcella off to a political marriage in Dorne. However, Cersei was more angered in the sense that she felt something was being taken which ''belonged'' to her.\n\nThus it is all the more shocking when in later books, as they grow older, Myrcella and Tommen increasingly turn into major characters in the very midst of House Lannister, on the scale of Arya or Bran Stark, where before they were treated as non-entities. The other family members and courtiers (and by extension, the readers or TV viewers) are even criticized for ignoring them this entire time, and simply assuming they were content. The smiling children seen in public at the Tourney of the Hand in book/Season 1 hide a darker and empty family life. Later books also retroactively reveal that Tommen has lived in terror of Joffrey their entire lives.\n\nAt one point Tommen even says that he used to &quot;go away inside&quot; mentally when Joffrey did certain things to him, though the exact extent of what he did (killing his pets or something far more sinister) has not been made clear.\n\nHowever, despite their parents' loveless marriage, absent father, sociopathic and abusive older brother, willfully blind and functionally absent mother, Myrcella and Tommen still seem to have a good and genuinely loving relationship between the two of them, as fellow-sufferers sharing a household with Cersei and Joffrey. Thus Tommen burst into tears when Myrcella left on her ship for Dorne, because in many ways he was losing the only family member who he loved, and who reciprocated his love.\n\nTommen goes to the tournament for Joffrey's nameday, having been given permission by Cersei to do a practice mounted sword fight against a quintain with a straw filled mannequin as his opponent. Joffrey sees that the quality of the jousting is poor (the Hound says they are all gnats, and Ser [[Dontos Hollard]] shows up drunk), and Joffrey decides to cancel the whole thing. Tommen and Myrcella protest, as Cersei said Tommen could take part, and Joffrey can't just cancel it. When Joffrey says they are acting childish, Myrcella responds, &quot;We are children. We are supposed to act childish.&quot; The Hound laughs and says, &quot;She's got you there.&quot; Joffrey relents and Tommen enthusiastically tries, but is knocked off of his horse, to Sansa and Myrcella's concern and to Joffrey's raucous laughter. Then Sansa realizes that Tommen has picked himself up and wants to try again. She realizes that even at eight years old, Tommen has all the kindness, determination, and character that Joffrey lacks and she wishes she was to marry him instead.\n\nTommen is not present in King's Landing during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] in the books. Instead, while Cersei viciously punishes subordinates who flee the city, she hypocritically sends Tommen to the nearby town of Rosby so he will be safe during the battle. Also, she had been furious when Myrcella's marriage contract and transport to Dorne had been arranged by Tyrion without her input, and she wants Tommen away from King's Landing and out of Tyrion's power. Tyrion learns of it and decides it's a good idea, as it will ensure both Tommen's safety and that there is still a claimant to the throne for their faction, should the approaching [[Stannis Baratheon]] take King's Landing and have Joffrey executed. He lets the plan go through, but then sends gold cloaks under Ser Jacelyn Bywater to intercept Tommen on the road so Tyrion's own forces will be in control of Tommen's security at Rosby. Cersei is incensed, and she has Ser [[Boros Blount]] stripped of his white cloak of the Kingsguard for letting them just take over security and have Tommen, instead of what he should have done, which was dying fighting them. Cersei later takes the prostitute Alayaya prisoner, thinking that she is Tyrion's lover [[Shae]], threatening her safety if Tyrion lets anything happen to Joffrey or Tommen during the battle (in the TV series, the prostitute was changed to [[Ros]], and the subplot about Tommen in Tyrion's custody was cut, so Cersei only warned Tyrion about Joffrey's safety).\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Tommen Baratheon&quot; is pronounced &quot;TAH-min Buh-RATH-ee-un&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Tom-men&quot;, etc.\n\n", "Quotes": "\n{{Dialogue a-b-a|Tommen|Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?|Cersei|He might.

She has gotten a vial of [[Essence of Nightshade]] from Grand Maester [[Pycelle]], which is deadly if taken in more than tiny amounts and she prepares to give it to him if the city defenses fail, to grant him the mercy of a quick death instead of being captured and tormented.

Initially, he laughed at his brother's crude play with dwarves depicting the War of the Five Kings but stopped after noticing the look upon his uncle Tyrion's face. After Joffrey's poisoning and subsequent death, Tommen inherits the crown and is now the king and ruler of the [[Seven Kingdoms]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tommen_4x02.jpg|thumb|131px|Tommen during Joffrey's Wedding Feast]]\n\nTommen later stands vigil with Cersei over Joffrey's corpse in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. [[Tywin]], in an unusually agreeable mood, enters and proceeds to grill Tommen on the traits that make a good king, ignoring Cersei's angry glares. Tommen offers holiness, justice and strength as qualities of a good king, but Tywin refutes these ideas by pointing out that Kings [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor]], Orys, and Robert were each paragons of one of these qualities, but not very good kings. Tywin is delighted when Tommen, with minimal prompting, suggests that a good king must be wise. Tywin tells Tommen that young kings with no experience must be wise by listening to their councilors, and the wisest kings keep listening even when they don't need to anymore. As he escorts Tommen out of the Sept, Tywin begins prepping his grandson on the duties of a king's marriage. On their way out, Jaime passes them and asks how Tommen is doing; the young king replies that he is all right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Breaker of Chains]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tommen-and-Cersei.jpg|thumb|left|226px|Tommen and Cersei mourn over Joffrey's death.]]\n\nIn response to Joffrey's death, Cersei insists that Tommen be placed under high guard, with at least four Kingsguard at his bedroom door at night, something Jaime finds a bit excessive. Tommen has been moved to Joffrey's bedchamber and has yet to redecorate; hence, he has difficulty sleeping with Joffrey's gruesome hunting trophies all around. That night [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] sneaks into Tommen's chambers. She suggests that they get to know one another before their marriage, something nobles in Westeros don't usually do. Tommen is unnerved by her presence until his cat, [[Ser Pounce]], jumps up and Margaery interacts with him. Tommen sullenly reveals the cruel things Joffrey threatened to do to Ser Pounce, and he and Margaery bond over their mutual relief that they are free of him. Tommen agrees that he'd like Margaery to visit him again. Margaery departs, but not before giving a kiss on the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Margaerytommen.png|thumb|224px|Margaery visits Tommen in his bedchambers.]]\n[[File:Tommens-Coronation.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Tommen is crowned by the High Septon.]]\nA ceremony is held in the [[Red Keep]] where the [[High Septon (After the Riot of King\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Landing)|high septon]] officially crowns Tommen as king.
