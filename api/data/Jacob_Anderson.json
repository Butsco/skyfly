Like fellow ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' actor [[Ed Skrein]], he has collaborated musically with British singer [[wikipedia:Plan B (singer)|Plan B]].\n\nIn ''Game of Thrones'' he is playing the role of [[Grey Worm]]. He was announced in the role on August 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;August 20, 2012. [http://winteriscoming.net/2012/08/daario-naharis-and-grey-worm-cast/ Daario Naharis and Grey Worm Cast.] Winter is Coming.net.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAll of Grey Worm's lines in Season 3 were in [[Low Valyrian]]. Linguist [[David J. Peterson]], who designed all of the languages on the TV series, heaped massive amounts of praise on Anderson in his blog throughout Season 3. Peterson is in outright awe of Anderson's skill at delivering lines in his constructed languages: Anderson perfectly matched the stringent pronunciation rules which Peterson devised for his constructed languages - which was praiseworthy in and of itself - but in addition was able to emote and act the lines flawlessly. That is, Anderson didn't just learn the lines as a string of sounds, but paid close attention to what each verb and noun are so he knows which words he should logically be emphasizing - subtle nuances that only a fluent speaker of Low Valyrian would really be able to detect. Anderson's skill at Peterson's constructed languages rivals that of Emilia Clarke. Peterson would go on to lament every episode in which Grey Worm had few or no speaking lines, i.e. in &quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)]]&quot;, Daenerys orders Grey Worm to deliver her terms to Yunkai's leaders, and he acknowledges with a simple nod, but Peterson lamented that he didn't compose a paragraph-long and flowery speech for Grey Worm to give expounding upon why he was happy to follow the order.\n\nAnderson has credited Peterson's skill with languages as being vital for the character. He also said he was not recognized publicly for some time after the third season aired, until someone yelled out their recognition on the New York subway. Since then he has been recognized more often, and fans alternate between calling him by his real name, his musical stage name and his character name.&lt;ref&gt;Interview on ''Sunday Morning Kitchen'', Channel 4 (UK), 13 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "References": "{{Reflist}}\n\n"}, "title": "Jacob Anderson"}
