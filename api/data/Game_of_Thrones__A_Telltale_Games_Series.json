The Forresters are a family of the minor nobility from the [[Wolfswood]] in [[The North|the North]], bannermen to [[House Glover]] - who are in themselves major vassals sworn to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. The seat of House Forrester is Ironrath, an imposing stronghold in the forest surrounded by ironwood trees. Their [[House words]] are &quot;Iron from Ice&quot;, echoing their belief that the severe cold and hostile landscape of the North only make them stronger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/finally-a-game-of-thrones-video-game-that-looks-worthy-1661233364/+charliejane Kotaku]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHouse Forrester does actually exist in the novels, and they are a minor House in the Wolfswood who serve as vassals to House Glover. However they were only mentioned in passing once and its current members were not described: &quot;''...guides Lady Sybell [Glover] had given them, trackers and hunters sworn to Deepwood with clan names like Forrester and Woods, Branch and Bole.''&quot; (''A Dance With Dragons'', Chapter 42) With no details given about its current members in the novels, this gives the video game a blank canvas to fill new characters with.\n\nThe events in the game series generally coincide with [[Season 4]], beginning towards the end of [[Season 3]] and ending just before [[Season 5]] begins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telltale&quot;&gt;[http://www.telltalegames.com/blog/86265/your-story-begins-first-details-on-game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series First Details] - The Telltale Blog ''(Nov 11, 2014)''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPlayers will visit familiar locations such as [[King's Landing]] and [[The Wall|the Wall]], as well as unfamiliar locations such as Ironrath, the home of House Forrester. The game will be played from five different points of view. Each character you play as is a member of House Forrester; either a direct family member, or a person in service to the House. Scattered across Westeros and Essos, each character will play their part in seeking to save House Forrester from destruction. Playing as five characters not only reflects the epic scope of ''Game of Thrones'', but is also something that the player needs to be mindful of. This is because the actions of one character can ripple out to affect the rest of House Forrester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telltale&quot; /&gt;\n\nActors from the main ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]'' TV series will reprise their roles for the video game, providing voice-acting for the in-game appearances of their characters. [[Lena Headey]] (Cersei), [[Peter Dinklage]] (Tyrion), [[Natalie Dormer]] (Margaery), and [[Iwan Rheon]] (Ramsay). Other actors and characters from the main TV series will appear in later episodes.\n\n", "TOP": "Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series020386aprmk55m1nf2wx5u56i6890xcki17zq1809542015-04-04T05:49:41Z73.32.111.65/* Overview */{{Game\n|image = TTG GoT Logo.png\n|episodes = 6\n|releasedates = '''December 2, 2014'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;PC/Mac ''(Worldwide)''&lt;br&gt;PS4 ''(North America)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''December 3, 2014'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Xbox One ''(Worldwide)''&lt;br&gt;Xbox 360 ''(Worldwide)''&lt;br&gt;PS4 ''(Europe)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''December 4, 2014'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;iOS ''(Worldwide)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''December 9, 2014'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;PS3 ''(Worldwide)''&lt;/small&gt;\n|platforms = Microsoft Windows&lt;br&gt;Mac OS X&lt;br&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;br&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;br&gt;Xbox 360&lt;br&gt;Xbox One&lt;br&gt;iOS&lt;br&gt;Android\n}}\n\n'''''Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series''''' \u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;is an episodic video game based on the [[HBO]] television series, released in 2014 and consists of six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/telltalegames/status/531838754898460672 @telltalegames] - Twitter ''(Nov 10, 2014)''&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed in conjunction with HBO by [[wikipedia:Telltale Games|Telltale Games]], developers of the critically praised video game spinoffs for ''[[Wikipedia:The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' and ''[[Wikipedia:The Wolf Among Us|The Wolf Among Us]]''.

Each Great House has about a dozen or so major noble Houses immediately sworn to them. In the North, these include [[House Umber]], [[House Manderly]], [[House Karstark]], and [[House Glover]], among others. All told this means that there are a little over one hundred major noble Houses in Westeros, almost all of which have been accounted for in the novels. However, each of the major noble Houses also have their own minor noble Houses that serve them as local bannermen. For example, [[House Cassel]] is a local minor House in direct service to the Starks, not one of the major noble Houses like the Umbers ([[George R.R. Martin]] has said that in retrospect, he should have used distinct terms for the three different ranks of nobles, such as &quot;duke&quot; and &quot;baron&quot;, instead of each holding the rank of &quot;Lord&quot;). Given that each major noble House has a couple of minor Houses serving as local bannermen, there are apparently ''hundreds'' of minor Houses which have never been mentioned in the novels, with the main novel mostly focusing on the large-scale conflicts between entire kingdoms.\n\nEssentially, the video game is focusing on a representative &quot;everyman&quot; minor House, to show how the [[War of the Five Kings]] is impacting people on a local level.\n\nWesteros is a large continent, not simply one country, so the unified realm under the [[Iron Throne]] is on the scale of the Roman Empire, and each constituent kingdom such as &quot;the North&quot; is the size of an entire real-life medieval country, with armies numbering in the tens of thousands. Major Houses such as the Umbers or Karstarks can raise armies from their combined minor bannermen numbering in the low thousands. Minor noble Houses who are bannermen to the others have forces numbering in the hundreds at most.\n\n", "Voice cast": "===TV series cast reprising their roles===\n*[[Lena Headey]] as [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Natalie Dormer]] as [[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Iwan Rheon]] as [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n\n===Characters introduced in the video game===\n*[[Daniel Kendrick]] as [[Gared Tuttle]]\n*[[Martha Mackintosh]] as [[Mira Forrester]]\n*[[Russ Bain]] as [[Rodrik Forrester]]\n*[[Alex Jordan]] as [[Asher Forrester]]\n*[[Christopher Nelson]] as [[Ethan Forrester]]\n*[[Robin Atkin Downes]] as [[Gregor Forrester]], [[Duncan Tuttle]] &amp; [[Andros]]\n*[[Lara Pulver]] as [[Elissa Forrester]]\n*[[Molly Stone]] as [[Talia Forrester]]\n*[[Louis Suc]] as [[Ryon Forrester]]\n*[[J.B.
