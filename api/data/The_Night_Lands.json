She is drawn to the caged prisoners when [[Jaqen H'ghar]] asks her for water and introduces himself. A pair of [[Gold Cloaks]] approach the party and Arya hides, believing that they have come for her. They deliver a warrant for the Royal bastard [[Gendry]] but [[Yoren]] intimidates them into leaving empty handed. They promise to return with more men.\n\nArya asks Gendry why he is wanted and he admits that he does not know. He tells her that he was questioned by Lord [[Jon Arryn]] and Lord [[Eddard Stark]] in the months before he fled King's Landing. He questions why she thought that they had come for her and tells her that he has seen through her disguise. Arya reveals her identity to him and swears him to secrecy.\n\nIn [[King's Landing]], [[Varys]] discovers [[Shae]] living with [[Tyrion Lannister]] in the [[Tower of the Hand]] and makes implied threats about revealing her presence. Tyrion warns Varys not to underestimate him. [[Alton Lannister]] delivers King [[Robb Stark]]'s peace terms to the [[small council]] and Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] rejects them. [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] relays a message from the [[Night's Watch]] requesting manpower and warning of [[wights]]. Tyrion is the only one to take the warning seriously.\n\n[[Ros]] struggles to continue her work as a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] having witnessed the murder of the infant royal [[Bastardy|bastard]] [[Barra]]. [[Petyr Baelish]] threatens her with a tale about selling an unhappy girl to a depraved customer in order to recoup his investment. He orders her to return happy after a night off.\n\nTyrion has Lord [[Janos Slynt]] for dinner and questions him about the [[Massacre in King's Landing|massacre of the royal bastards]]. Janos freely admits his involvement but will not reveal who ordered the attack. Tyrion has Janos arrested and exiled to the [[Night's Watch]] and installs [[Bronn]] as Commander of the [[City Watch]] in his place. Cersei confronts Tyrion about his actions. He warns that she is losing the support of the people but she claims that she does not care. He concludes that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] ordered the massacre, having initially suspected that it was Cersei. He jokes about her relationship with [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and she says that he has always been funny. She ends the discussion with the barb that his finest joke was killing their mother when he was born.\n\nOn [[Dragonstone]], [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] recruits the [[Lys]]ene [[sellsail]] [[Salladhor Saan]] and his fleet of thirty ships to King [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s cause. His son [[Matthos Seaworth]] encourages him to learn to read so that he can study the holy texts of the [[R'hllor|Lord of Light]] but Davos is happy to put his faith solely in Stannis. [[Melisandre]] seduces Stannis with the promise of a son.\n\n[[Theon Greyjoy]] travels to the [[Iron Islands]] on a merchant ship and sleeps with the [[Captain's daughter]]. He tells her that he is expecting a warm reception and is crushed when there is no one to meet him when he disembarks in [[Lordsport]]. A woman offers him a ride to [[Pyke (castle)|Pyke]] and he attempts to seduce her throughout the journey. He is further disappointed when his father [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] questions his loyalty and his memory of his roots having spent nine years as a ward of [[House Stark]]. He delivers [[Robb Stark]]'s letter suggesting an alliance against [[House Lannister]]. His guide enters and he is shocked to realize that she is his sister [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] when Balon greets her warmly. Balon rejects the proposal and compares Theon unfavourably to his sister. He insists that he will follow the [[Ironborn|ironborn]] tradition of paying the [[Iron price|iron price]] (meaning to take something through force) and says that no-one will give him his crown. When Theon warns his father that he will not defeat the Lannisters, Balon retorts that he has no intention of fighting the Lannisters.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\n[[File:Daenerys 202.jpg|thumb|190px|Daenerys waits for news]]\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] and her [[khalasar]] lie exhausted in the heat, their water dwindling as they wait for the return of her bloodriders. [[Rakharo]]'s horse returns riderless and Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] discovers his head and severed braid in its saddle bag. He surmises that Rakharo was caught and killed by a rival khalasar. [[Irri]] is devastated by the death and believes the mutilation will prevent Rakharo from entering the [[Night Lands]], the [[Dothraki]] land of the dead. Daenerys promises to hold a funeral for Rakharo.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\n[[Samwell Tarly]] rescues one of [[Craster]]'s wives, [[Gilly]], from [[Ghost]] when he bothers her for food. She confides her desire to flee from the keep because of her fear for what Craster will do if her unborn child is a boy. Sam takes her to Jon and she begs him to take her with the ranging but will not say what she is afraid of. [[Jon Snow|Jon]] refuses to aid her because of the [[Lord Commander]]'s orders not to get involved with Craster's wives.\n\nJon notices Craster taking a baby into the woods at night. He follows him and sees him leave the child to the [[White Walkers]]. Before he can intervene Craster surprises him and knocks him out.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Liam Cunningham]] as Ser [[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Stephen Dillane]] as King [[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Carice van Houten]] as [[Melisandre]]\n*[[Jerome Flynn]] as [[Bronn]]\n*[[Conleth Hill]] as Lord [[Varys]]\n*[[John Bradley]] as [[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as [[Shae]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Guest starring'''\n*[[Julian Glover]] as [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]]\n*[[Robert Pugh]] as [[Craster]]\n*[[Patrick Malahide]] as King [[Balon Greyjoy]]\n*[[Francis Magee]] as [[Yoren]]\n*[[Dominic Carter]] as Lord [[Janos Slynt]]\n*[[Tom Wlaschiha]] as [[Jaqen H'ghar]]\n*[[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Gendry]]\n*[[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]]\n*[[Ben Crompton]] as [[Eddison Tollett]]\n*[[Roxanne McKee]] as [[Doreah]]\n*[[Amrita Acharia]] as [[Irri]]\n*[[Steven Cole]] as [[Kovarro]] (credit only)\n*[[Ben Hawkey]] as [[Hot Pie]]\n*[[Eros Vlahos]] as [[Lommy|Lommy Greenhands]]\n*[[Esme Bianco]] as [[Ros]]\n*[[Andy Beckwith]] as [[Rorge]]\n*[[Gemma Whelan]] as Princess [[Yara Greyjoy]]\n*[[Kerr Logan]] as [[Matthos Seaworth]]\n*[[Lucian Msamati]] as [[Salladhor Saan]]\n*[[Hannah Murray]] as [[Gilly]]\n*[[Karl Davies]] as Ser [[Alton Lannister]]\n*[[Amy Dawson]] as the [[Captain's daughter]]\n*[[Sahara Knite]] as [[Armeca]]\n*[[Jer O'Leary]] as [[Lordsport dockhand]]\n*[[Gerard Jordan]] as [[Biter]]\n*[[Daniel Portman]] as [[Podrick Payne]]\n*[[Ian Whyte]] as a [[White Walker (The Night Lands)|White Walker]]\n*[[Sam Callis]] as a [[Goldcloak on the Kingsroad]]\n*[[Derek Reid]] as [[Ros's dissatisfied customer]]\n*[[Josephine Gillan]] as [[Marei]]\n*[[Dennis Stokes]] as a [[male prostitute]]\n\n'''Uncredited'''\n*[[Dennis McKeever]] as [[Night's Watch Officer 2]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n*Only 15 of the 25 starring cast members for the second season appear in this episode.\n*Starring cast members [[James Cosmo]] ([[Jeor Mormont]]), [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] ([[Jaime Lannister]]), [[Charles Dance]] ([[Tywin Lannister]]), [[Natalie Dormer]] ([[Margaery Tyrell]]), [[Michelle Fairley]] ([[Catelyn Stark]]), [[Jack Gleeson]] ([[Joffrey Baratheon]]), [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] ([[Bran Stark]]), [[Richard Madden]] ([[Robb Stark]]), [[Rory McCann]] ([[Sandor Clegane]]), and [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n*Alfie Allen is credited ahead of Maisie Williams when he was credited after her in &quot;The North Remembers&quot;.\n*John Bradley is credited after Stephen Dillane, Carice Van Houten, Jerome Flynn and Conleth Hill when he was credited before them in &quot;The North Remembers&quot;.\n\n", "Notes": "*The title refers to the [[Night Lands]], the land of the dead in [[Dothraki]] religion. Irri is devastated that Rakharo will not go to the Night Lands because his body was mutilated by his killers without being burned.\n*The scene in which Rakharo's severed head is discovered and Irri mourns his death (in a protracted exchange of [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki language]] dialogue) was filmed as part of the next episode, &quot;What is Dead May Never Die&quot;. It was moved to this episode in post-production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dothraki.com/2012/04/rhaeshi-ajjalani/ David J. Peterson's blog]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Tyrion's removal of Janos Slynt is not entirely of his own initiative: in the books, his father Tywin considered it one of Cersei's many follies that she handed out the drastically disproportionate reward of a seat on the Small Council and lordship of Harrenhal to a lowborn and infamously corrupt man like Janos. Thus, Cersei can't overturn the decision to remove him, because Tyrion had explicit orders from Tywin to do so, which also berated Cersei for elevating Janos in the first place. However, it was Tyrion's decision to not only strip him of his title but exile him to the Wall, because he felt he was of questionable loyalty and because he was disgusted that Janos was a baby-killer.\n*A screenshot of Robb Stark's letter to Balon Greyjoy, which he sent Theon to deliver, was posted in the In-Episode Guide for this episode.

Thus a considerable amount of thought actually went into Melisandre's line in this episode that Stannis has &quot;no ''sons''&quot;, because they wanted to leave their options open to later say that he does have a daughter (and as it turned out, the TV series was ultimately able to introduce Shireen in Season 3):\n**&quot;At that point, we honestly didn't know if we would include Shireen or not \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; we never know how many characters this show can handle so we sometimes hedge one way or the other. So we made it clear that Selyse had given Stannis &quot;no sons&quot;, leaving the door open for Shireen if we needed her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Season_3_Interview_Bryan_Cogman Westeros.org,] Season 3 Interview: Bryan Cogman.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Memorable quotes": "'''[[Tyrion Lannister]]''': &quot;I don't like threats.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''[[Varys]]''': &quot;Who threatened you?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''[[Tyrion Lannister|\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Tyrion Lannister]]''': &quot;I am not Ned Stark, I know the way this game is played.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''[[Varys]]''': &quot;Ned Stark was a man of honor.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''[[Tyrion Lannister]]''': &quot;And I am not, threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n'''[[Varys]]''': &quot;You might be disappointed with the results.
