It is located on the [[Cockleswhent]] river north east of Highgarden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/highgarden/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Highgarden entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ashford is the seat of House Ashford. It consists of a castle, a surrounding town and a large meadow nearby which is a perfect location for [[tournament]]s.\n\nAshford is the site of two important events in the history of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. In 209 AL Ashford was the site of a tournament where the much-storied [[knight]] Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] first began his rise to fame and where he first met his even more famous companion, [[Aegon V Targaryen|Egg]]. Prince [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor 'Breakspear' Targaryen]], the king's heir, was also accidentally killed during this tourney, changing the future history of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nIn 281 AL, during [[Robert's Rebellion]], Ashford was the site of a major battle and [[Robert Baratheon]]'s only notable defeat. The army of [[House Tyrell]] was advancing towards the [[Stormlands]] with the intention of destroying Robert's army and taking [[Storm's End]]. Robert elected to fight a field battle rather than withstand siege and intercepted the Tyrell army near Ashford. Robert attacked the Tyrell vanguard (which Robert's army outnumbered at a local level, since the bulk of the Tyrell army had not yet arrived). However, Lord [[Randyll Tarly]], commanding the Tyrell van, withstood the attack and drove the Baratheon army from the field. Robert's army was defeated, but managed to withdraw in good order northwards towards the [[Riverlands]]. The Tyrell army was commanded to march on to Storm's End (held by [[Stannis Baratheon]]) and besiege it rather than pursue Robert. This proved unwise, as Robert was able to combine his army with those of the [[House Stark|Starks]], [[House Arryn|Arryns]] and [[House Tully|Tullys]], enabling him to ultimately triumph in the war.\n\n"}, "title": "Ashford"}
