Since the death of her husband, she has commanded a khalasar containing only a few dozen riders, less than half of whom are warriors, as well as a single trained [[knight]], [[Jorah Mormont]]. During her time in the Red Waste and Qarth, her dragons were not large enough to provide any meaningful assistance.\n\nBy the time Daenerys reached [[Astapor]] in [[Slaver's Bay]], her dragons had grown enough to provide limited air support in certain engagements, and she had gained the loyalty of an additional knight, Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. It should be pointed out that although limited, the dragons are capable of providing the only air support in the known world.\n\nFollowing the [[Sack of Astapor]], Daenerys gained an army of 8,000 fully trained [[Unsullied]], elite warrior-eunuchs who fight in large, disciplined phalanx formations, as well as several hundred Unsullied-in-training who serve as auxiliaries.\n\nShortly after arriving at [[Yunkai]], Daenerys is able to secure the affection of [[Daario Naharis]], a lieutenant in the [[Second Sons (mercenary company)|Second Sons]]. During a [[parley]] between Daenerys and the captains of the Second Sons, Daario points out that Daenerys's Unsullied are impressive infantry, but she still possesses no cavalry, siege weapons, or ships. Later that night, Daario slays the captains of the Second Sons, makes himself captain, and pledges the company to Daenerys. The Second Sons add 2,000 armored cavalry to the growing Targaryen army.\n\n===Westeros===\nThere are no official allies or vassals of House Targaryen left in Westeros. [[Varys]] is implied to be secretly a Targaryen loyalist, but by himself he commands no military forces and cannot be considered a military asset.\n\nKing Robert Baratheon expressed fear that even after all these years, there are still a sizeable number of noble Houses in Westeros who are either secret Targaryen loyalists, or who later developed some grievance with Robert's rule, and would flock to the Targaryen banner if they attempted to retake the Iron Throne in open war. It is not clear to what extent paranoia influenced his opinions, since Ser Jorah stressed to Dany that the number of Targaryen loyalists in Westeros is far lower than Viserys liked to believe. Viserys, at least, believed that because House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne fought on the Targaryen side during Robert's Rebellion, the prospects were good that they'd be willing to join his cause and rebel against Robert. Thus far, there has been no evidence that dissatisfied houses would support a Targaryen return, and House Tyrell\u00c2\u00a0has become closely aligned with the Lannister-backed House Baratheon.\n\n", "TOP": "House Targaryen02116sohz2xwyxblepla0c3slgpdz3kirrri1747432015-02-28T04:08:40ZThe Dragon Demands5014364{{Noble house\n| Title=House Targaryen\n| Image=Targaryen.JPG\n| Sigil=A red three-headed dragon,&lt;br&gt; on a black field.\n| Words='''&quot;Fire and Blood&quot;'''\n| Titles=\n| Seat=[[Meereen]]&lt;br&gt;[[Dragonstone]] (former)&lt;br /&gt;[[King's Landing]] (former)\n| Region=[[Slaver's Bay]] &lt;br /&gt;(formerly [[the Crownlands]])\n| Lord=Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n| Heir= none\n| Allegiance=\n| Vassals=\n| Cadets=[[House Blackfyre]] (extinct)\n| Age= Rulers of Dragonstone island since 500 years ago.

A common error, even in [[Westeros]], is to depict the Targaryen dragon with six limbs rather than four.]]\n\n'''House Targaryen''' is a former [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]] and was the ruling royal House of the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries, before it was deposed during [[Robert's Rebellion]] and [[House Baratheon]] replaced it as the new royal House. The few surviving Targaryens fled into exile. House Targaryen's [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a three-headed red dragon on a black background, and their words are '''&quot;Fire and Blood&quot;'''.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Targaryen moved from Valyria to Dragonstone, apparently in fear of a prophecy predicting the destruction of Valyria a century before it happened. After the fall of Valyria, the Targaryens stayed on Dragonstone for a hundred years, apparently hoarding the strength of their dragons and debating whether to invade Westeros or to attempt to seize control of the Valyrian colony-states which later became known as the Free Cities. In the event, they chose to invade Westeros instead.\n\nHouse Targaryen ruled Westeros for 283 years, during which time they survived substantial civil wars (including the Dance of Dragons and no fewer than five Blackfyre Rebellions), plague (the Great Spring Sickness), and an attempted foreign invasion (in the War of the Ninepenny Kings). They were brought down when the Mad King's insanity became too dangerous to be ignored.\n\nThe Targaryens adopted the religion and many of the customs of Westeros, but they clung to two old Valyrian customs in defiance of public disapproval: Targaryen princes and kings were allowed to have multiple wives, and Targaryens were allowed to marry brother to sister&amp;mdash;something considered an abominable sin elsewhere in Westeros.\n\nThe generations of Targaryen inbreeding produced a distinctive set of physical features shared by all of their members during the House's three centuries of rule. This includes a generally pale appearance with silver-white (platinum blonde) hair and purple irises. While pale, they are not albinos, although their eyebrows are white. The actors playing Daenerys and Viserys are actually dark-haired, so they had to wear wigs. (Some obsessive fans observed that the actors didn't dye their eyebrows white to match.) The TV series opted not to portray the Targaryens with purple eyes, partially due to the logistical difficulty of matching purple contact lenses for actors in every shot. The TV series originally filmed Viserys and Daenerys wearing violet contact lenses, but show creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss quickly abandoned their use. As they explained in the Season 1 Blu-ray episode commentaries, &quot;actors act with their eyes, and [the lenses] really hurt the emotion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays Den of Geek]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Targaryen&quot; is pronounced &quot;Tar-GAIR-ee-in&quot;.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nTargaryen icon.png|HBO viewer's guide icon for House Targaryen.\nTargaryen sigil.jpg|House Targaryen's sigil in black and white from the HBO viewer's guide.\nTargaryen Shield.jpg|A shield emblazoned with the sigil of House Targaryen from the HBO viewer's guide.\nHouse Targaryen Sigil.jpg|The sigil and motto of House Targaryen.\nTargaryen-small.png|Small icon of House Targaryen from the HBO viewers guide.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nOnce a noble family of the vast [[Valyrian]] Freehold, an empire spanning most of the eastern continent, the Targaryens were given control of the island of [[Dragonstone]] in the [[Narrow Sea]] some centuries ago. After the obliteration of Valyria in the Doom, the Targaryens launched a devastating invasion of Westeros using three [[dragons]] to spearhead their attack. In a short period of time, six of the seven formerly independent kingdoms had surrendered to the Targaryen leader, King [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon I]], unifying the continent under his rule. The last hold-out, [[Dorne]], joined the kingdom through a political and marriage alliance some two centuries later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viewers Guide&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the increasingly erratic reign of King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]], his son [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] kidnapped [[Lyanna Stark]] of [[Winterfell]] for unknown reasons. This sparked a [[Robert's Rebellion|massive uprising]] led by [[Eddard Stark]], [[Robert Baratheon]] and [[Jon Arryn]]. At the end of this war Aerys and Rhaegar were dead and the Targaryen power-base in Westeros destroyed.

Allegedly, this also preserved in their bloodline the ability to successfully bond with and ride dragons. They also seem to be somewhat more tolerant of extreme heat and high temperatures than other people, though they are by no means invulnerable to fire \u00e2&euro;&ldquo;\u00c2\u00a0or at least, not\u00c2\u00a0all of them.\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Viserys Targaryen]] arranges for the marriage of his sister [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] to the powerful [[dothraki]] [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] in exchange for a promise that Drogo will help him to reclaim his crown.

Illyrio gives Daenerys a trio of ancient dragon eggs as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Daenerys comes to love both Drogo and his people while Viserys is increasingly frustrated by Drogo's failure to deliver on his promise.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Daenerys becomes pregnant with Drogo's son and he is prophesied to be the &quot;Stallion that mounts the world.&quot; Frustrated by the acceptance of Daenerys by the Dothraki, Viserys drunkenly threatens her unborn child and demands his crown. Drogo kills him by pouring molten gold over his head.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDrogo then pledges to invade [[Westeros]] for Daenerys when she survives an assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He raids villages of the [[Lhazareen]] to enslave their inhabitants, intending to use them to barter passage across the [[Narrow Sea]]. He takes a superficial wound when he is challenged by [[Mago]] for apparently taking orders from a woman, namely Daenerys, who wants to spare the female slaves from being raped by the dothraki.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned that the wound could fester and become infected, Daenerys turns to the captive [[Mirri Maz Duur]] to treat him. Duur's reputation as a &quot;maegi&quot; causes friction between Daenerys and Drogo's warriors. Duur deliberately infects this wound, causing Drogo's life to become endagered. Unaware of Duur's actions, Daenerys allows her to use [[blood magic]] to treat Drogo, using the blood of Drogo's horse. His bloodrider [[Qotho]] violently objects, injuring Daenerys and triggering premature labor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Duur's spell leaves Drogo catatonic and Daenerys's son stillborn. His khalasar splinters leaving Daenerys with only dozens of riders remaining. After a tearful, loving farewell speech, Daenerys smoothers Drogo with a cushion. She then has Duur burned alive on his funeral pyre, also placing her dragon eggs among the flames. Duur dies in agony in the fire, her screaming filling the night air. Daenerys then steps into the fire, but the next morning, it is revealed that she is unharmed and holding the dragon hatchlings in her hands.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nDaenerys's adviser Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] warns that rival khals will target her and advises that she flee into the [[Red Waste]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Her crossing is harrowing and she loses the majority of her horses (namely her own, Drogo's first gift to her) and some of her people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in [[Qarth]] she is allowed into the city under the protection of wealthy merchant [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Xaro makes a pragmatic marriage proposal, promising to fund Daenerys return to Westeros in exchange for becoming her husband. Jorah counsels against entering Xaro's debt and reveals his own, unrequited, feelings for Daenerys.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Daenerys refuses Xaro's offer after finding her ''khalasar'' slaughtered and her dragons missing. After retriving them, Daenerys locks Xaro in his own vault along with one of her handmaidens, who was sleeping with Xaro. With her dragons once more by her side, she and the remnants of her ''khalasar'' raid Xaro's wealthy home.\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nHaving seized as much of Xaro's wealth as she and the remnants of her ''khalasar'' could carry, Daenerys and her retainers flee Qarth by ship. Daenerys reluctantly takes Jorah's advice to make for [[Astapor]], a city in [[Slaver's Bay]] known for its warrior-slaves. Jorah feels that using their wealth to purchase an army is her best course of action. Shortly after their arrival, Daenerys is nearly assassinated by one of the remaining [[Warlocks]], but is rescued by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], who has tracked her down to pledge fealty to House Targaryen once again.\n\nHouse Targaryen's fortunes take a dramatic turn when Daenerys double-crosses the Good Masters of Astapor, seizing their elite Unsullied and burning the slave-owning elite with the dragon she pretended to sell to him. Daenerys thus becomes the first Targaryen in generations to march at the head of her own conquering army.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDaenerys turns her attention to Yunkai, where she manages to win over the [[Second Sons (mercenary company)|Second Sons]] and liberate that city from the Wise Masters.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nThe now-sizeable Targaryen army moves on the largest slaver city, Meereen.
