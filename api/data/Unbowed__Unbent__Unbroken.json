It is the forty-sixth episode of the series overall.  It will premiere on May 17, 2015. It was directed by [[Jeremy Podeswa]].\n\n", "Notes": "*This episode takes its title from the [[House words|motto]] of [[House Martell]] of [[Dorne]]:  &quot;Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken&quot;, which refers to the fact that Dorne is the only one of the Seven Kingdoms never to be successfully conquered by outsiders. When the [[War of Conquest|Targaryens conquered the rest of the Seven Kingdoms]] three centuries ago, the Dornish were able to resist them by resorting to guerrilla warfare, harassing Targaryen armies in their deserts until they withdrew. The Martells only united with the [[Iron Throne]] one century ago, but through a voluntary marriage-alliance on equal terms. This naming choice is similar to how the first episode of Season 1 was named &quot;[[Winter is Coming]]&quot;, after the House words of the Starks, and the Season 1 finale was named &quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;, after the words of [[House Targaryen]].\n\n"}, "title": "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"}
