House Gardener ruled as the [[Kings of the Reach]] until the invasion of [[Aegon the Conqueror]]. King [[Mern IX Gardener]] and all his issue were slaughtered by Aegon's [[dragons]] on the [[Field of Fire]], so Aegon raised the Tyrells, the stewards of Highgarden, to rule over Highgarden and the Reach. This sparked off a long-standing complaint from [[House Florent]] of [[Brightwater Keep]], who claimed a superior blood-link to the Gardeners, though this has been constantly dismissed by later kings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/highgarden/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Highgarden entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/highgarden/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Highgarden entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/highgarden/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Brightwater Keep entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\n\nDuring the tournament held by [[King]] [[Renly Baratheon]], when [[Ser]] [[Loras Tyrell]] duels with [[Brienne of Tarth]], [[Margaery Tyrell]] cheers on her brother by standing up from her seat and shouting &quot;Highgarden!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Renly is assassinated, most of his bannermen from [[the Stormlands]] submit to his older brother [[Stannis Baratheon]].

It is next to the river [[Mander]]. Highgarden sits on the point where the [[Roseroad]] linking [[Oldtown]] and [[King's Landing]] forks off west on the [[Searoad]] which leads to [[Lannisport]]. As King's Landing, Oldtown, and Lannisport are the first, second, and third largest cities in [[Westeros]], heavy trade and traffic to and from Oldtown ultimately passes through Highgarden.\n\n", "Notable residents of the castle": "* Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]], known as the Queen of Thorns, the dowager-lady of the house.
