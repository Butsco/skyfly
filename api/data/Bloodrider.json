Bloodriders seat next to the ''Khal'' in feasts and ceremonies. They may also share the ''Khal'''s wife, but never his horse. A bloodrider may also be a ''ko'', commanding a subdivision of the ''khalasar''.\n\nIf a ''khal'' is killed, bloodriders are expected to avenge him. Once done, their last service is to escort the Khaleesi to [[Vaes Dothrak]] to join the [[Dosh khaleen]]. Then they are to join the ''khal'' in death.\n\nDaenerys' bloodriders are Aggo, Jhogo and Rakharo.
