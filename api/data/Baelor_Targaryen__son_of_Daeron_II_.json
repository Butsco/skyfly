Exactly how it sounds: seven men against seven men. Makes for a good show, but any man who has been in battle knows that the more men involved, the less skill needed, the more chance of accidents. Just ask that Targaryen prince who got his head staved in by his brother all those years ago, and all for some hedge knight.|[[Bronn]]|Justice of the Seven Kingdoms}}\n'''Baelor Targaryen''' is an unseen character in ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''. He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it begins.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Prince Baelor was the eldest son of King Daeron the Good and Queen Myriah, and named after Baelor I. He had the dark hair of his mother, Queen Myriah, which he kept it cut short and kept his jaw clean-shaven. His nose had been broken twice. He was known as &quot;Baelor Breakspear&quot; and was the father of Princes Valarr and Matarys Targaryen.\n\nWhen the Blackfyre Rebellion was in its early stages, Prince Baelor advocated leniency toward [[Daemon Blackfyre]], a position that was rejected in favor of his uncle [[Brynden Rivers]]' hard line. Nonetheless, Baelor accepted the path towards war and distinguished himself by leading the Dornish-Stormlands force which attacked the rearguard of the rebel army during the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]], smashing them against the shield-wall of his brother, Prince Maekar, and inspiring the song ''The Hammer and Anvil''. After the battle, he was named [[Hand of the King]] by his father. At some point he was also given the title of [[Protector of the Realm]].\n\nWhile participating in a rare seven versus seven man variant of a [[Trial by combat]], Baelor's younger brother Maekar accidentally dealt him a severe blow to the head with his mace. Baelor had entered the trial wearing his son's lighter armor, which did not fit properly and didn't provide adequate protection.  Maekar had not meant to severely harm Baelor, and Baelor seemed fine at first, acknowledging that it was an accident.  Soon, however, Baelor started behaving drunkenly, and he actually had a severe concussion from which he died in a matter of hours.  The guilt of accidentally killing his own brother haunted Maekar for the rest of his days.\n\nWhen he died his son Valarr\u00c2\u00a0became heir-apparent to the Iron Throne, but he and his younger brother Matarys\u00c2\u00a0both died during [[Great Spring Sickness]] only hours before\u00c2\u00a0Daeron II. This lead Daeron\u00c2\u00a0II to be succeeded by his second son, Aerys I.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nThe Hammer and the Anvil.png|Baelor battles his brother [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]] in the [[Trial by seven of Duncan the Tall]]\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Baelor Targaryen}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nPrince Baelor was the eldest son of King [[Daeron II Targaryen]] and Queen [[Myriah Martell]].
