They were called dragonlords because they could ride and control [[dragons]]. They controlled dragons with whips, horns and [[Magic|sorcery]]. They were strikingly (some say inhumanly) beautiful. It had long been the custom amongst the dragonlords of Valyria to wed brother to sister, to keep the bloodlines pure.\n\nThe [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] were a minor dragonlord family, far from the most powerful, but are the only family that survived the [[Doom of Valyria]] with dragons. Thus members of [[House Targaryen]] are known as dragonlords in [[Westeros]], even after the death of all the dragons.\n\n"}, "title": "Dragonlords"}
