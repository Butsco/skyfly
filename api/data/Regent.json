When ruling in the name of a child, a regent's rule ends when the child heir reaches adulthood. In the [[Seven Kingdoms]], the legal age of adulthood is 16 years old.\n\nWhen a regent rules in the name of the [[King of the Andals and the First Men]], he or she may also hold the title of [[Protector of the Realm]]. A royal regent also holds a seat in the [[Small Council]], taking the place of the young monarch. While a regent functionally rules in place of an underage monarch, only the actual ruler and the [[Hand of the King]] may sit on the [[Iron Throne]] itself. For this reason, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister sits on a gilded chair at the foot of the throne.\n\nIf a king dies and his own queen acts as regent for their children, she is known as the &quot;Queen Regent&quot;. Since a regency, by definition, requires a king's death, the title &quot;King Regent&quot; is never used; a male acting as regent for a king would hold the title &quot;Lord Regent&quot;. Regents for regular lordships may be called &quot;Lord (Lady) Protector&quot; or &quot;Lord (Lady) Regent&quot;.\n\n", "Historical regents": "*Queen {[[Sharra Arryn]]} was regent for her son, King [[Ronnel Arryn (King)|Ronnel Arryn]],\u00c2\u00a0at the time of the [[War of Conquest|Targaryen Conquest]].
