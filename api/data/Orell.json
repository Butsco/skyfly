He has an affinity for animals including his pet eagle. Orell is killed in the confrontation with [[Qhorin Halfhand]]'s scouting party, during which Orell is inhabiting his eagle. A portion of Orell's consciousness remains within the eagle, and develops a deep hatred of Jon. The eagle then aids Rattleshirt in tracking and capturing Jon and Qhorin and attacks Jon, scarring him.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nOrellS3.jpg|Orell in Season 3\nOrellWarg.jpg|Orell while warging\nRain_of_castamere_orell.png|Orell is killed by Jon Snow\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n", "Appearances": "{{Season Three Appearances|2=yes||yes|yes||yes|yes|yes||yes}}\n\n", "Biography": "===[[Season 3]]===\n\nWhile the massive host of the [[Free Folk]] marches out of [[Skirling Pass]] through [[the Frostfangs]], Orell scouts the [[Fist of the First Men]] by warging into his pet eagle.

Here they encounter the bloody aftermath of assault on the Night's Watch by the [[White Walkers]] and their army of undead [[Wights]].

As Tormund is about to murder the breeder, Orell intervenes and says that the &quot;crow&quot; should do it. Jon walks forward and presses his sword against the man's jugular, but stops the murder and shoves him away, only to be shot by Ygritte. Orell shouts and claims that Jon always was a &quot;crow&quot; and a battle ensues. After a few moments of sword fighting, Jon shoves his sword into Orell's chest and whispers &quot;You were right the whole time&quot;,\u00c2\u00a0before pulling it out and leaving\u00c2\u00a0Orell on the ground to die.\n\nOrell manages to cheat death, however, warging into the mind of his eagle with his dying breath. As Jon stands over Orell's dead human body, Orell's consciousness controlling the eagle's body attempts to exact revenge by clawing at Jon's face with his beak and talons, but Jon is able to fight him off.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Orell"}
