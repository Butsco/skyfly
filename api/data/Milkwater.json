It is created from several tributaries that originate in the [[Frostfangs]], and runs south along the mountain range until it pours its waters into the [[Bay of Ice]].  It carves a deep gorge through the mountains as it empties into the sea at the western end of [[the Wall]], which is guarded by [[the Shadow Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;Season 2 Bluray: War of the Five Kings feature&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Milkwater has four main branches, none of which has been revealed to have a formal name - they are all considered part of &quot;the Milkwater&quot;.  One major branch runs all the way north along the mountain range, almost to the valley of the [[Thenn]].  The next branch runs northwest from the [[Fist of the First Men]], north of the [[Skirling Pass]].  A third branch runs south of the Fist and the Skirling Pass.  The fourth and southernmost branch actually doesn't originate in the Frostfangs, but in the [[Haunted Forest]] to the east.  Indeed, it extends as far east as [[Castle Black]] (though at a much more northern latitude), and runs past [[Craster's Keep]].  This final branch joins the river somewhat north of the Shadow Tower.  \n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Milkwater"}
