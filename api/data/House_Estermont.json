Queen Cersei was miserable the entire fortnight they spent with the Estermonts while King Robert enjoyed hunting, hawking, drinking, and play fighting with his maternal uncles and male cousins. He also took to reconnecting and comforting a female cousin whose father and husband died in the [[siege of Storm's End]] and eventually spent the night with her. That same night Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] offers to kill King Robert, but Queen Cersei says she wants him &quot;horned&quot; instead. She likes to think that was the night when her son [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] was conceived.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Blackwater Bay]], Lord Eldon bends the knee to King Joffrey, though some members of House Estermont remain loyal to Lord Stannis.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "[[George R.R.
