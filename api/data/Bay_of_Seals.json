It is part of the [[Shivering Sea]]. The bay runs from the [[wildling]] territories [[beyond the Wall]] to the [[Grey Cliffs]] north-east of [[Karhold]]. [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], the eastern-most castle on [[the Wall]], is located on the edge of the bay. The [[Night's Watch]] controls the coast southwards for 150 miles (the eastern edge of [[the Gift]]). The coast south of that is controlled by [[House Umber]]. [[House Karstark]] controls much of the southern coast of the bay.\n\nThe islands of [[Skane]] and [[Skagos]] (amongst others) are located in the bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/castle-black/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Castle Black entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "References": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Bay of Seals is reported as being difficult to cross in autumn, as storms make it almost impassable.
