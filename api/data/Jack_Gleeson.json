He has a minor role in the film ''[[wikipedia:Batman Begins|Batman Begins]]'' and received a number of outstanding reviews for his lead role in the film ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1507250/ All Good Children]'', with [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942831?refcatid=31 Variety] describing him as &quot;''the pic's big discovery''.&quot;\n\nHe starred in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. He was announced in the role on 19 July 2009. He was part of the starring cast from Season 1 until Season 4 when he was killed off. In 2012, he announced his intention to retire from acting to focus on his studies once his work on the show was complete.\n\nGleeson was born in Cork, Ireland. He is a student of Trinity College Dublin and a member of DU Players. As a result, Gleeson's natural speaking voice actually has a pronounced Irish accent: the upper-class, Received Pronunciation accent he adopts while playing Joffrey on-screen is a conscious part of his performance. In the Blu-ray commentary for &quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;, [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark]]) explains that for amusement between takes, the English-accented Turner and Irish-accented Gleeson would imitate one another's accents.\n\nGleeson said that when he was cast he read ahead on Wikipedia, so he already knew how his character ultimately died, instead of it coming as a shock in Season 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/new-blu-ray-video-extra-game-of-thrones-fallen-roundtable/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Jack Gleeson"}
