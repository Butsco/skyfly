The Stormlands were under the control of [[Argilac]] the Arrogant of [[House Durrandon]], the [[Storm King]].\n\nEven though the massive walls of [[Storm's End]] provided protection against Baratheon's siege, Argilac\u00c2\u00a0decided to meet the invading armies in open battle after hearing about how Aegon Targaryen's dragon [[Balerion]] destroyed [[Harrenhal]]. Orys Baratheon and the Targaryen army were victorious and\u00c2\u00a0Argilac was killed.\n\nAs a reward for the victory, Aegon legitmized\u00c2\u00a0Orys Baratheon\u00c2\u00a0and named him\u00c2\u00a0[[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]]. To cement his rule, Baratheon took Argilac's daughter, [[Argalia]], as his wife.

However, Argilac was motivated in this by having heard of the death of [[Harren Hoare]] in similar circumstances at [[Harrenhal]], who prepared for a siege in his immense castle only for the Targaryen dragons to fly right over the walls. If Argilac resisted a siege by Orys it would only be a matter of time until the Targaryens directed their dragons to the castle, so wishing to avoid this fate Argilac met Orys in pitched battle. It is possible that Argilac knew he couldn't win, but simply wanted the dignity of dying while fighting, not burned out of his castle like a rat.\n\nOrys's army suffered a defeat on the march to Storm's End but was able to recover with minimal losses and continue. Orys was accompanied by Aegon's sister-wife [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and her dragon [[Meraxes]], though because Rhaenys was not as militaristic as her sister Visenya or as skilled as a general, Orys remained in command of their army.\n\nDespite Aegon's success at Harrenhal, the battle against Argilac was grueling: he had the sense to sally forth to attack during one of the frequent lightning storms which blew in from [[Shipbreaker Bay]], during which it was too dangerous for Meraxes to fly. Orys was outnumbered two-to-one, and at one point was outflanked, but then Rhaenys plugged the gap riding Meraxes on the ground - even denied the advantage of flight, the fire-breathing dragon was still formidable. The battle culminated when Orys faced Argilac in single combat and slew him on the battlefield.\n\nAfterwards Argilac's daughter Argella barred the gates of the castle, proclaimed herself Storm Queen, and vowed to fight on, but she was betrayed by her followers and handed over to Orys naked and in chains. Orys treated her with courtesy, freeing and feeding her, and accepted her surrender. Orys later married Argella to cement his control over the Stormlands, and in the process founded House Baratheon.\n\n"}, "title": "Last Storm"}
