One of these was a &quot;dusky rose&quot;.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 4]]===\n[[Daario Naharis]] gives [[Daenerys Targaryen]] a Dusk rose in a handful of flowers he has picked for her, ostensibly to show her the lay of the land around Meereen, but truly a thinly veiled attempt to woo her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Dusk Rose"}
