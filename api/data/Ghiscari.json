Modern Ghiscari culture is centered on the cities of [[New Ghis]], [[Astapor]], [[Yunkai]], and [[Meereen]]. Although the modern Ghiscari claim descent from the ancient [[Ghiscari Empire]], its fall and subjugation by the [[Valyrian Freehold]] five thousand years ago make this claim tenuous at best. Culturally, ethnically, and even linguistically, the modern Ghiscari are very much descendants of the [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] slave populations who simply embrace what few elements of Old Ghis have survived the millennia.\n\nGhiscari no longer speak the language of their forebears but a [[Low Valyrian|dialect]] of [[High Valyrian]] which also includes words of the [[Old Ghiscari|dead]] Ghiscari tongue.\n\nThe aristocracies of the Ghiscari cities: the [[Good Masters|Good]], [[Wise Masters|Wise]], and [[Great Masters]], wear the ''[[tokar]]'', a traditional Ghiscari garment worn only by the powerful and rich.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the modern Ghiscari are a people clinging to the glorious past of the Ghiscari Empire. Their culture, language and religion, however, has been largerly replaced by that of their Valyrian conquerors.\n\nModern Ghiscari have dense, dark amber skin, and wiry hair with dyed red highlights. Ghiscari men the Slaver Cities are known to wear their hairs teased, oiled, and twisted into fantastic shapes such as wing or horns. They also wear cloaks of yellow with copper disks sewn on. Their tunics are embroidered linen. Below the waist they wear pleated linen skirts and sandals. The richest classes, who are primarily made up of slavers, wear the ''tokar'', an intentionally impractical outfit that forces the wearer to hold it with a hand - and a symbol of status, that the wearer does not perform any kind of labor. Ghiscari are also fond of rich foods, such as dog, octopus stew, and duck eggs.\n\nJust as their Valyrian rivals are often associated with [[dragons]], Ghiscari associate themselves with the symbol of the defunct Ghiscari Empire: the [[harpy]].\n\n", "Prominent Ghiscari": "\n* [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]], of the [[Good Masters]] of [[Astapor]].
