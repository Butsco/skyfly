The TV series expanded on the idea that her mother was a &quot;noblewoman from the east&quot;, to say that Nymeria's mother was actually from the very far east of Essos, apparently from [[Yi Ti]] (the narrative's fantasy analogue of Ancient China).  The result is that Henwick's character is the first prominent East Asian actor to play a prominent speaking role in the TV series.\n\nOn training to use Nymeria's signature bullwhip weapon, Henwick said:\n\n:&quot;Nymeria is the most strategic of the three sisters and I think her whip is very representative of her character. It's not about brute force with a whip... it's about balance and timing, precision and accuracy \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; and all those things are very much Nymeria...Because of our different personalities we have different ideas of how to get to that point. If Obara has an obstacle she goes right through it, whereas Nym will stop and look back and think, 'What's the way with which I have to expend the least amount of energy to get through this obstacle?' She's observant, I'd say.\n\n:I had six months between my first session and us actually getting round to filming the fight scene. I worked with Paul Shapcott, who is from New Zealand and worked on the Hobbit films. He knew the bullwhip and he taught me how to hit targets. At one point he was throwing toilet rolls into the air and I was having to hit them out of the air....Other times he would put sticks in various positions around our rehearsal room and I\u00e2&euro;&trade;d have to go and wrap my whip around them, and then for the last one I'd have to lock it in place so I could actually pull the stick away. It\u00e2&euro;&trade;s like learning to ride a bike \u00e2&euro;&rdquo; once you know it, you can always go back to it. It's just about feeling the balance and the weight of it...Yeah! They made a proper whip for me that has a bronze handle. It's made from kangaroo skin, it\u00e2&euro;&trade;s 8ft-long and it\u00e2&euro;&trade;s really heavy. That\u00e2&euro;&trade;s the one I had to use for close-ups. Then for the majority of the fights, I used one that looked identical but the handle was rubber and plastic, rather than bronze. It was a lot easier for me; it didn't throw me off balance. And then they did have a standby whip, the third whip, which was just a handle. They said, 'This is in case it gets too dangerous,' but actually I never really worked with that one. The whole time I said, 'I've learnt it, I've learnt how to do it. Can I do it?'And they kept saying, 'No you're gonna have to use the safety whip.' But every time we got to set, I would use the real whip.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150329/jsp/t2/story_11347.jsp#.VR6xovnF9Cj ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "External links": "*\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;{{Template:WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 3725055}}\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;\n*{{Template:Twitter\n|# = JHenwick}}\n\n"}, "title": "Jessica Henwick"}
