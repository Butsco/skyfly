She says that she wants to see him and he asks her to believe him when he says that she does not. She asks if he has already looked. When he does not answer she says that she will be the first. She unwraps his scarred face and he winces as she pulls the bandages away from his wound. The scar extends diagonally from his left brow to his right jaw, crossing the bridge of his nose. The flesh around the injury is pink and the wound edges are puckered and scabbed. He asks for her opinion and she shrugs and says that he is a mess.&lt;ref name=&quot;E20&quot;/&gt;\n\nHe says that he is a monster as well as a dwarf and suggests that she charge him double.

He checks that Sansa has been invited to join Cersei and the other highborn ladies in [[Maegor's Holdfast]]. Sansa affirms that she has but explains that King Joffrey has summoned her to see him off. Joffrey, the Hound and three other members of the Kingsguard enter from behind the throne. Joffrey calls Sansa over as Tyrion deadpans that Joffrey has always been a great romantic. Sansa says that she will pray for Tyrion\u00e2&euro;&trade;s safe return. Tyrion doubts her and she says that she will pray just as she will for the king. Sansa goes to Joffrey leaving Tyrion alone with Shae for a moment. He tells her to stay safe, she reciprocates calling him her lion. Joffrey leads his men out of the throne room and Sansa returns to Shae. Shae watches them leave and tells Sansa that some of the boys will never come back.

Sansa and Shae are already there and Sansa wonders why Cersei invited her. She says that Cersei always tells her how stupid she is and believes confides her belief that Cersei hates her. Shae suggests that Cersei may hate her less than she hates everyone else. Sansa says she doubts it and watches as Cersei\u00e2&euro;&trade;s handmaid pours a glass of wine. Shae suggests that Cersei is jealous of Sansa and Sansa wonders what reason Cersei could have to be jealous of her. Cersei calls Sansa over to her bed on the dais, forcing her to join her in drinking wine and mentally tormenting her.&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot;/&gt;\n\nCersei notices Shae watching them from across the room and says that she has not seen her before. Cersei approaches Shae and calls her pretty. Shae stands and attempts to curtsey. Cersei calls it the worst she has ever seen and demonstrates how to do it properly. Shae mimics her movements and Cersei says that she learns quickly. She asks how long Shae has served Sansa and Shae tells her it has been just a few weeks. Cersei instantly recognizes her Lorathi accent and asks when she left there. Cersei does not wait for an answer and observes that Shae is lowborn. Shae\u00e2&euro;&trade;s smile fades and Cersei asks when she came to Westeros. Shae says that it was ten years ago. Cersei wonders how Shae went from a Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years without being able to curtsey. She asks Shae\u00e2&euro;&trade;s name and asks her to tell her story. Shae hesitates and then begins at the age of thirteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot;/&gt;\n\nShae is rescued by the arrival of Lancel. He bursts in shouting for Cersei. He reports Tyrion\u00e2&euro;&trade;s destruction of the fleet and the landing of Stannis\u00e2&euro;&trade;s troops. Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey inside. He objects saying that the presence of the King is good for morale. Cersei again tells Lancel to bring Joffrey back to his chambers. Lancel wonders why not to her side and she sarcastically asks if he wants Joffrey to be mocked as a coward for hiding behind his mother\u00e2&euro;&trade;s skirts. Cersei sits back down and reveals to that Ser Ilyn is there to kill them should the Red Keep be breached.&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot;/&gt;\n\nLancel returns to Cersei and tells her that the battle has been lost. He says that Stannis\u00e2&euro;&trade;s troops are at their gates and that the goldcloaks lost all heart when Joffrey left. Cersei asks where Joffrey is. Lancel does not answer and instead says that he wants to escort him back to the battle. Cersei asks why she should care what Lancel wants. Lancel asks her to listen. She stands and pushes his wounded side. He falls back into a stone pillar, screaming in pain.

Shae says that she has told Varys about how they met and Tyrion glares at her. Varys says that Tyrion was lucky to find such a lovely creature working in his [[Tywin Lannister|father]]'s kitchens and that the story almost beggars belief. Tyrion says that strange things do happen and offers that Varys should taste Shae's fish pie. Shae says that she doubts that Varys likes fish pie. Varys wonders how she knows and she giggles and says that she can always tell. Tyrion says that Varys and he must not let their disadvantages get the best of them. Varys says that he is glad that Tyrion's new friend could accompany him and adds that friends are an important part of life. He observes that it was unfortunate that Tywin did not want Shae to come. He offers the reassurance that he is very good at keeping secrets for his good friends. Tyrion says that Varys's discretion is legendary where his friends are concerned.

She asks about him and he reminds her that he does not come from the city and says that he is a slave to the truth. Shae says that he is the biggest little liar she has ever met and he responds by saying that he is so small because of the weight of so much truth pressing down on him.

Sansa is dismissive as she knows no-one of that name in King's Landing and expects the local standard. Sansa says that she does not have time to teach her how to do her job.
