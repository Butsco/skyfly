She's described as being not as pretty as her sisters, but her beauty matured as she got older. Her eyes were soft lilac and her hair was platinum-white with a gold streak down the middle, which she wore long, pulled back and in a braid. She liked to dress in black, like her father. Elaena was eleven when she was confined along with her sisters and cut off her hair in protest, wearing it short for a while.\n\nShe married three times, twice at a king's behest and once for passion, and gave birth to seven trueborn children. She then declared that if seven was sufficient for the [[The Seven|Gods]], it would do for her as well. Although she had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, the Oakenfist, with whom she had two bastard children, Jon and Jeyne Waters.\n\nElaena was known as being shrewd and intelligent, to the point that even though one of her husbands sat on the [[small council]] as [[Master of Coin]], it was widely known that she was the one performing the duties.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nElaena Targaryen was a Princess of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty and a sister of [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]], who imprisoned her along their sisters [[Daena Targaryen|Daena]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] at the [[Maidenvault]] to prevent carnal temptations.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Red Keep (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Elaena Targaryen"}
