The battle was only possible due to some impressive maneuvering by Lord Robert's army from [[the Stormlands]], which had to travel through hundreds of miles of enemy territory to link up with the [[Stark]], [[Tully]], and [[Arryn]] forces north of the river.\n\nThe battle itself was on a large scale, with Prince Rhaegar leading 40,000 royalist troops. The rebels had slightly less, but the rebels were more experienced due to almost a year of warfare beforehand. The battle was quite bloody with high casualties on both sides, but in the end it was the royalist force which broke and ran, after Prince Rhaegar's death at the hands of Robert Baratheon. After Prince Rhaegar was killed, men on both sides stole the rubies that bejeweled his armor and crown.  \n\nThe rebel side included the the main armies from the North and the Vale.  Robert's army from the Stormlands had to fight its way north and was much diminished, but the remaining soldiers were battle-hardened veterans.  The River lords were split between the rebels and royalists, though the Tullys fought on the rebel side.  House Darry, in contrast, were a major Riverlands House that fought on the Targaryen side.  \n\nThe bulk of the royalist army was composed of the full strength of the Targaryen bannermen in the Crownlands, augmented by 10,000 Dornishmen.  This was supported by several royalist Riverlands Houses, and surviving royalist armies from previous battles such as the [[Battle of the Bells]].  There were a few men present from the Reach and House Tyrell at the battle, but the bulk of the Tyrells' army was tied down at the Siege of Storm's End away to the south.  \n\nOther notable characters present at the battle included Lord [[Jon Arryn]], Lord [[Hoster Tully]], and Lord [[Roose Bolton]]. The latter, following the rebel victory, suggested that\u00c2\u00a0Ser Barristan Selmy be killed, but Robert was so impressed by the valor and loyalty that Barristan had shown in the battle that he spared his life, even sending his own [[Maesters|maester]] to tend to Barristan's wounds instead of his own, which were less serious. After the war, Robert even made Barristan the Lord Commander of his own Kingsguard.\n\n", "History": "===Battle===\n\nPrince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] was slain by Lord [[Robert Baratheon]] during the battle, resulting in a crucial and critical victory for the rebel forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/rhaegar-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Rhaegar Targaryen entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Rhaegar was killed at a ford in the river from a swing by Robert's warhammer.

Unable to ride, Robert sent his most trusted ally, Lord [[Eddard Stark]], south to secure the [[King's Landing|capital]]. Lord Eddard, however, arrived to find the city already [[Sack of King's Landing|sacked]] by [[Lannister]] forces as a show of fealty to the rebellion.\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe defeat marked the beginning of the end for the Targaryen dynasty. No army stood between the rebels and King's Landing, the only other royalist armies being [[Mace Tyrell]]'s army besieging Storm's End and [[Tywin Lannister]]'s marching from [[Casterly Rock]] towards the capital. Since Robert was wounded in the battle, it fell to Eddard to lead the rebel army south towards King's Landing, hoping to arrive before the Lannister reinforcements.\n\nSer Barristan was close to death when he was brought before Robert. Though he was counseled to kill him, Robert spared his life, and even sent his own maester to tend to his wounds.\n\nLord [[Walder Frey]], [[Lord of the Crossing]] and Lord [[Hoster Tully]]'s bannerman, did not appear until the battle was done, for which Lord Tully nicknamed him &quot;the late Walder Frey&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Battle of the Trident"}
