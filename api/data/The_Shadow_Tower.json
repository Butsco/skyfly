It is located close to the western end of the Wall. At the time of the series, the Shadow Tower is one of only three castles on [[the Wall]]\u00c2\u00a0still manned by the\u00c2\u00a0[[Night's Watch]],\u00c2\u00a0along with [[Castle Black]] and [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. There are nineteen castles along the Wall, but as their numbers fell over the centuries the Night's Watch had to abandon sixteen of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/castle-black/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Castle Black entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "Known residents": "*Ser [[Denys Mallister]], an old knight and commander of the Shadow Tower.&lt;ref&gt;Season 2 Bluray: War of the Five Kings feature&lt;/ref&gt;\n*{[[Qhorin]]}, called &quot;Qhorin Halfhand&quot;, leading Ranger of the Shadow Tower.

It is not the western-most castle on the Wall, which used to be Westwatch-by-the-Bridge. However, Westwatch has fallen into ruin and is no longer garrisoned. [[Qhorin Halfhand]] was usually based at the Shadow Tower.\n\nAccording to [[Jeor Mormont]], at the start of the books there are about 200 soldiers in the Shadow Tower. Qhorin led 100 of them to the [[Great Ranging]].\n\nPatrols and scouts from the Shadow Tower have to keep a close eye on the surrounding terrain. Though extremely difficult, it is possible to by-pass the Wall by descending through the Gorge and crossing the Bridge of Skulls, or by tracing a dangerous route through the [[Frostfangs]] to the west. The Night's Watch has to keep an eye on these routes for signs of [[wildling]] activity.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 3]]===\n\nWhen [[Jon Snow]] infiltrates the wildlings, [[Orell]] asks him which of the nineteen castles along the Wall are still manned by the Night's Watch.
