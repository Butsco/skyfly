As a result, they are &quot;Salty Dornishmen&quot;: when the [[Rhoynar]] migrated to Dorne a thousand years ago, they primarily settled around the coasts and river valleys, and in these places their bloodlines had the largest impact. Salty Dornishmen tend to have olive skin, dark hair and eyes, and somewhat short but lithe stature. The coasts of Dorne also enjoy a fair amount of trade with the nearby [[Free Cities]] across the [[Narrow Sea]].\n\nThe heraldry of House Dalt apparently refers to the fact that Dorne, the southernmost of the Seven Kingdoms, is the only region in Westeros where citrus fruits grow.

However, they are still considered one of the more powerful Houses from Dorne.\n\nThe members of House Dalt at the time of the novels are:\n*Ser Deziel Dalt, the Knight of Lemonwood.\n*Ser Andrey Dalt, his brother and heir.
