A ''khaleesi''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s status varies greatly from ''[[khalasar]]'' to ''khalasar''. She could be very influential, riding next to the ''khal'', or she could be worth practically less than the ''khal''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s horse, since the ''khal''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[bloodriders]] would sometimes share the ''khaleesi'', but never share the ''khal''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s horse.\n\nIt is Dothraki tradition that if a ''khal'' dies, his ''khaleesi'' must retire to join the crones that rule [[Vaes Dothrak]], known as the ''[[dosh khaleen]]''. [[Daenerys Targaryen]], however refused this and instead declaring herself a ''khaleesi'' in her own right and formed her own ''khalasar'' from what few of Drogo's people hadn't abandoned her.\n\n==Known ''Khaleesi''==\n* [[Daenerys Targaryen]], called &quot;Daenerys Stormborn&quot; and &quot;Mother of Dragons&quot;, self-styled &quot;''Khaleesi'' of the Great Grass Sea&quot;.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;''khaleesi''&quot; is pronounced &quot;khal-EE-see&quot;.
