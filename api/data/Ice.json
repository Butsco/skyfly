However, due to Ice's substantial size, there's enough [[Valyrian steel]] to make two longswords. When Jaime asks about the source of the Valyrian steel, Tywin simply replies that the previous owner no longer needed it. Tywin Lannister also burns Ice's wolf-pelt scabbard.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe second blade is given to King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] as a wedding gift on the breakfast before the wedding ceremony. Of all the names proposed by the attendants, Joffrey chooses &quot;[[Widow's Wail]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nJaime later gives his blade to [[Brienne of Tarth]] to aid her in her task of rescuing [[Sansa Stark]]. He reasons that it is appropriate for Ned Stark's daughter to be protected with a sword forged from her father's own sword.

As a Valyrian-forged weapon, it never needs sharpening. Its\u00c2\u00a0blade has a dark and smokey appearance (instead of the appearance of common steel in the TV series). Ned uses Ice to execute the [[Night's Watch]] deserter [[Gared]] and also to sacrifice [[Lady]]. After his father's execution, among the demands made by [[Robb Stark]] in exchange for peace was that the sword be returned to House Stark.\n\nIn the books, it is actually the Qohorik blacksmith [[Tobho Mott]] who reforges Ice into two smaller swords at Tywin's order. The Free City of [[Qohor]] is famous for its blacksmiths, who still know how to reforge Valyrian steel (but not create new Valyrian steel outright). Thus while the knowledge of reforging it is rare, it isn't limited to ''only'' three living smiths, as Tywin says in the TV series.\n\nFor unknown reasons, Mott was unable to forge the two new swords in crimson as Tywin ordered, no matter how much he tried, but in mixed colors of red and the original grey.\n\nWhen Joffrey is presented with a new Valyrian steel sword by Tywin at his [[Purple Wedding|wedding feast]] (which he names &quot;Widow's Wail&quot;), [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] realizes that Tywin has had Ice melted down and re-forged. He regrets not returning the sword to the Starks when it was requested.\n\n"}, "title": "Ice"}
