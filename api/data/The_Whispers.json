The castle is located north-east of King's Landing at the very tip of [[Crackclaw Point]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/kings-landing/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, King's Landing entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The Whispers are named for the eerie sound the sea makes as it crashes into the holes in the cliffs below the castle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/the-whispers/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, The Whispers entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/the-whispers/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, The Whispers entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* [http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Whispers The Whispers at A Wiki of Ice and Fire] (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Whispers was the former stronghold of House Crabb. Ser Clarence Crabb is said to have beheaded every enemy he slew in combat and brought them back home, where his wife kissed them, restoring them to life. Crabb kept the living heads - including an alleged King of [[Duskendale]] - in the castle, seeking their counsel. The Whispers is named in legend for the sound of the heads' whispering their advice to the knight.\n\nIn reality, the castle is most likely named for the sound of the water pouring through holes in the cliff below the castle. Coastal erosion has seen the castle's beacon tower collapse into the sea within the last two generations.\n\nThe lords of Crackclaw Point - including those of the Whispers - were a quarrelsome lot, refusing to accept the authority of any of the [[Andal]] kings. During the [[War of Conquest]], [[Visenya Targaryen]] flew to the area on her [[dragon]] [[Vhagar]] and won the allegiance of the people, promising they would hold fealty to the [[Iron Throne]] alone.\n\n"}, "title": "The Whispers"}
