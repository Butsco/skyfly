The holder is the ruler of the entire region of [[The Westerlands|the Westerlands]].\n\nThe Westerlands were originally a sovereign nation known as the ''[[Kingdom of the Rock]]'', until [[Aegon the Conqueror]] arrived in [[Westeros]] and united the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. [[House Lannister]], the richest family in the Seven Kingdoms, have ruled as the Lords of Casterly Rock for hundreds of years.\n\n[[Tywin Lannister]] is Lord of Casterly Rock at the beginning of the series. He inherited the title from his father [[Tytos Lannister]]. Typically, the Lord of Casterly Rock also holds the title of [[Warden of the West]].\n==\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;History==\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nDespite [[Tyrion Lannister]] being the heir to Casterly Rock since his elder brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is a knight of the [[Kingsguard]], Lord Tywin has made it clear that he has no intention of allowing Tyrion to be the Lord of Casterly Rock following his death. It is therefore not clear who the heir to Casterly Rock currently is.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nWith the [[Assassination at the Tower of the Hand|murder]] of [[Tywin Lannister]], Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] stands as the new Lady of [[Casterly Rock]] as Tywin's closest lawful heir, since [[Tyrion Lannister]] has been declared guilty of [[regicide]] and fled across the [[Narrow Sea]]. Although Jaime made a deal with Tywin to leave the Kingsguard and become his heir again, Tyrion's guilty verdict rendered that deal null, even if Tywin had lived.\n\n", "Lords of Casterly Rock": "*Lord {[[Tytos Lannister]]}\n*Lord {[[Tywin Lannister]]}, [[Hand of the King]] and [[Protector of the Realm]]\n*Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]]\n\n===Historical Lords of Casterly Rock===\n*[[Loren Lannister]]\n*[[Damon Lannister]]\n\n"}, "title": "Lord of Casterly Rock"}
