He is a fierce enemy of the [[Night's Watch]]. Though he refers to himself as the Lord of Bones, the Night's Watch dubbed him &quot;Rattleshirt&quot; as a mockery of the rattle sound produced by his armor.

The wildling commander is dismissive of Ygritte's arguments to keep him alive, as he already has [[Qhorin]] as prisoner. He relents, however, after Ygritte's insistence and the reminder that [[Mance Rayder]] would want to decide for himself whether the [[Bastardy|bastard]] son of [[Eddard Stark]] lives or dies. However, he threatens Ygritte to castrate Jon should he try to escape. As the warband and their prisoners march to Mance Rayder's camp in [[Skirling Pass]], Qhorin attacks Jon, blaming him for the deaths of [[Stonesnake]], [[Borba]] and [[Harker]].
