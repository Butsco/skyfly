It is by far one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. The head of the house is the [[Lord of Winterfell]]. Before the [[Targaryen]] [[Wars of Conquest|conquest]], the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.\n\nHouse Stark's sigil is a grey [[Direwolves|direwolf]] on a white field, sometimes white and pale green. They are one of the few noble Houses whose family words are not a boast or threat. Instead, the House Stark family motto is a warning '''&quot;Winter is Coming&quot;.'''\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Stark was founded by [[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Brandon the Builder]], a semi-mythical figure who is credited with building the [[Wall]] and [[Winterfell]], founding the [[Night's Watch]] and ensuring the survival of the people of Westeros after the mythical [[The Long Night|Long Night]] and the [[Age of Heroes|War for the Dawn]] against the enigmatic Others (called &quot;[[White Walkers]]&quot; in the TV series). The family has survived for over 8,000 years and was the independent royal house of the vast territories of the North until King [[ Aegon the Conqueror]] overran the southern half of the continent. By the time the King in the North, [[Torrhen Stark]], had gathered together his widely scattered bannermen, Aegon had already conquered most of the South. Particularly, Aegon had already used his [[dragons]] to inflict a crushing defeat on both the Westerlands and the Reach at the [[Field of Fire]]. Torrhen Stark finally advanced south to the Riverlands with the amassed armies of the North to a confrontation with Aegon, but upon seeing Aegon's vast numerical superiority and his dragons realized he had no hope of victory, and chose to bend the knee in submission.\n\nThe civil war known as [[Robert's Rebellion]] began when [[Lyanna Stark]] was kidnapped by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. Lord Rickard Stark and his son and heir Brandon both demanded her return from King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] and were executed by the Mad King for their presumption. Eddard Stark, now the head of the family, called the banners of the North to war, supported by [[House Baratheon]], [[House Tully]] and [[House Arryn]]. It was decided that [[Robert Baratheon]] would claim the throne due to his strong claim as the grand-nephew of a previous Targaryen king. During the civil war Stark troops were instrumental in several engagements, including the Battle of the Bells and the [[Battle of the Trident]], and it was Eddard Stark's forces which reached [[King's Landing]] just after the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] had sacked it, ensuring the city was turned over to Robert's army when it arrived. The Starks also proved instrumental in the later [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], lending troops used by Robert to storm the castle of Pyke and crush the uprising.\n\nIn the novels, all of Lord Eddard Stark's children take after their mother Catelyn's looks, possessing the auburn hair and blue eyes distinctive of House Tully. The one exception among Catelyn's children is Arya, who possesses the dark hair and stern long face typical of the Starks. While this has resulted in Arya being mockingly called &quot;Horseface&quot;, Ned assures her that she bears a striking resemblance to his beautiful deceased sister Lyanna when she was a girl. Jon Snow, as a bastard and not Catelyn's son, does not possess Tully blood. While Ned has never revealed the exact circumstances of Jon's birth, all agree that he bears such a striking resemblance to Ned that he is obviously his blood relative. Indeed, as a little girl Arya once feared that she might be a bastard because she and Jon share the same dark physical features (distinctive of House Stark), though Jon assured her that she was not.\n\nIn the novels, the Stark banner is a whole [[direwolves|direwolf]]. In the TV series, the Stark banner most often used is just a direwolf's head, though the alternate version showing the whole direwolf is also seen (i.e. on banners during the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]], tapestries at Winterfell, and Ned Stark's wax seal on the letter he sends to Stannis Baratheon). Further, the sigil in the books is just a grey direwolf on a white field. This is used in the TV series, but it also frequently uses a subtle variant which has the grey direwolf on a white field, surmounting a small green escutcheon at the bottom.\n\nMany houses sworn to House Stark in the books have yet to appear in the series:\n\n'''Lesser Houses'''\n*House Condon\n*House Fenn\n*House Flint of [[Flint's Finger]]\n*House Ironsmith\n*House Lake\n*House Lightfoot\n*House Locke\n*House Moss\n*House Overton\n*House Slate\n*House Stout\n*House Waterman\n*House Wells\n*House Woolfield\n\n'''Mountain Clans'''\n* Burley\n* Flint of the Mountains\n* Harclay\n* Nott\n* Liddle\n* Norrey\n* Wull\n\n'''[[Skagos]] Clans'''\n* Crowl\n* Magnar\n* Stane\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery spacing=&quot;small&quot;&gt;\nHouse Stark.jpg|The sigil of House Stark from the Maester's Path promotional campaign.\nStark icon.png|HBO viewer's guide icon for House Stark.\nStark sigil.jpg|House Stark's sigil in black and white from the HBO viewer's guide.\nStark Shield.jpg|A shield emblazoned with the sigil of House Stark from the HBO viewer's guide.\nHouse Stark sigil.jpg|The sigil and motto of House Stark.\nStark-small.png|Small icon of House Stark from the HBO viewers guide.\nHouse Stark and retainers.jpg|House Stark and their retainers receive the King at Winterfell in &quot;[[Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming]]&quot;.\nStark tourney.jpg|A long banner of House Stark at the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]] in &quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;.\nStark tourney 2.jpg|A short banner of House Stark at the Tourney of the Hand in &quot;The Wolf and the Lion&quot;.\nS2-fan-poster-stark.jpg|House Stark promo poster for &quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot; released 28 February 2012.\nEddard's letter.jpg|Eddard's letter to Stannis, the seal bearing the imprint of a direwolf in grey wax, in &quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;.\nStark map-marker.jpg|A map-marker used to represent House Stark forces.\nmhysa burning stark banner.png|The House Stark banner burns during the [[Red Wedding]] in &quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\u00c2\u00a0 (Spoilers from the books)\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nBefore the [[Targaryen]] [[Wars of Conquest|conquest]], the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the [[King in the North|Kings in the North]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark entry]&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Torrhen Stark]] was on the throne at the time of the Targaryen conquest and marched his army south to face them.

As Robb continues to march further in the Westerlands, many of his bannermen, such as [[Rickard Karstark]]\u00c2\u00a0who lost two of his sons, begin to lose faith in King Robb and are aware that he broke his vow to marry one of the daughters of Lord [[Walder Frey]] when he married [[Talisa\u00c2\u00a0Maegyr|Talisa&amp;nbsp;Maegyr]].
