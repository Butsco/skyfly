She is deceased when the events of the series begin. Lyanna Stark is the younger sister of major character [[Eddard Stark]]. Her [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapping]] by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] contributed to the outbreak of [[Robert's Rebellion]].\u00c2\u00a0She died near the very end of the Rebellion, but the exact circumstances are shrouded in mystery.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lyanna does appear, albeit only in flashbacks and visions. She is described as intelligent, tomboyish and willful, frequently compared to her niece Arya in terms of temperament and appearance. When Robert says that Lyanna would never have opposed him vehemently as Cersei does, Ned notes that Robert either overlooked or had forgotten Lyanna's iron will. It is also implied she was not as passionate about her betrothal as Robert was. She knew about Robert's philandering ways and felt his love for her wouldn't stop him sleeping with other women. When Rhaegar Targaryen\u00c2\u00a0won the great tourney at [[Harrenhal]], he crowned her the Queen of Love and Beauty over his own wife, an action that stunned all present. A year later, Rhaegar\u00c2\u00a0kidnapped\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0raped her,\u00c2\u00a0which\u00c2\u00a0led to Robert's Rebellion. During\u00c2\u00a0the war she was hidden at a remote location and defended by three members of the \u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;[[Kingsguard]], whom Eddard and his retainers had to kill. Only Eddard and [[Howland Reed]], a vassal of House Stark, survived. However, she died from unknown causes before they could successfully rescue her. Her last words were: &quot;Promise me, Ned.&quot;\n\nLyanna's death instilled in Robert a great hatred of the Targaryens, and he vowed not to rest until every last scion of the house was killed, though Eddard refused to let Lyanna's tragic death skew his views on justice and mercy.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|Do you want to know the horrible truth?
