It is divided into several branches.\n\nHouse Payne's [[Heraldry|heraldry]] consists of purple and white chequy with gold coins in the checks.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Payne is noted as a valued vassal of the Lannisters. Ser Ilyn Payne was a loyal and stalwart warrior in the service of Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] and commander of his personal guard. His tongue was torn out with hot pincers at the order of the [[Mad King]] after Ilyn was overheard suggesting that Tywin really ruled the realm (as [[Hand of the King]]) rather than the insane monarch. Tywin wasn't in a position to protest. After the rebellion overthrew the Mad King, [[Robert Baratheon]] made Ilyn King's Justice (head executioner) as a favor to Tywin Lannister.\n\nPodrick Payne is the only other member of the family to appear. He is a very distant cousin of Ser Ilyn's from a different branch of the family. He is a squire to [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\n", "Members": "* Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], the [[King's Justice]].\n* [[Podrick Payne]], a young [[squire]], a distant cousin of Ser Ilyn's from a lesser branch of the family.\n\n"}, "title": "House Payne"}
