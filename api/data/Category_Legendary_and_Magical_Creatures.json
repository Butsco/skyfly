For example, the &quot;Shadow&quot; creatures created by Melisandre are &quot;magical&quot;.\n\nDragons do not count as &quot;magic&quot; creatures because they are well-known to exist and are living, breathing animals - albeit they apparently have some sort of tie to magic in the world. Basically, following RPG rules, a &quot;magical creature&quot; is a &quot;summoned creature&quot;, while Dragons are actual animals.\n\nFor animals in general (Direwolves, Ravens, etc.), see [[:Category: Animals]].\n[[Category:Living Beings]]"}, "title": "Category:Legendary and Magical Creatures"}
