Their lands are in the heart of the [[Riverlands]], located along the banks of the Red Fork of the [[Trident]]. Their seat is known as [[Stone Hedge]]. The head of the house holds the title [[Lord of Stone Hedge]]. Their current lord is [[Jonos Bracken]].\n\nHouse Bracken's sigil is a red stallion on a golden shield with a brown field.\n\nThe Brackens hold an ancient grudge against their neighbors, the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]] of [[Raventree Hall]]. The two houses, which hold the blood of the [[First Men]] in their veins and merged with the invading [[Andals]] rather than being completely conquered by them, competed for the throne of the Riverlands when it was an independent kingdom. The enmity and competition continues to this day and was increased when House Bracken converted to the [[Faith of the Seven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/stone-hedge/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Stone Hedge entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Known members": "[[File:Brakens-and-Blackwoods.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Houses Bracken and Blackwood share a long-standing and mutual animosity.]]\n* [[Jonos Bracken|Lord Jonos Bracken]], the current head of the family.\n\n===Household===\n*{[[Kurleket]]}, a man-at-arms sworn to House Bracken.
