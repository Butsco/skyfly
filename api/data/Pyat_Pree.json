He draws a knife and charges at her, but is stopped by Drogon, Jhogo, and Rakharo.\n\nDaenerys soon learns that Pyat Pree is gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her.

Together with the rest of his order, he dwells in the mysterious [[House of the Undying]], located within the city of Qarth. Even though the power of and respect for the warlocks has considerably waned over years and many dismiss them as little more than charlatans performing parlor tricks, tradition and custom has allowed Pyat Pree a place among [[the Thirteen]].\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nPyat Pree is present when [[the Thirteen]] greet [[Daenerys Targaryen]] at the gates of [[Qarth]], and she and her people are allowed into the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Daenerys 2x05.png|thumb|Daenerys meets Pyat Pree.]]\nPyat Pree attends a reception for Daenerys in the gardens of the home of [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]. He personally welcomes Daenerys Targaryen on behalf of the Warlocks of Qarth. He gives her a gem and tells her to look into it until she can see herself in its facets. When she looks up Daenerys sees that there are now two of him talking to her. He invites her to come the [[House of the Undying]]. Xaro apologizes for the warlock, he says that though they are not thought highly of, it is customary to extend the warlocks an invitation.

He then stages a coup with the assistance of Pyat Pree and declares himself King of Qarth. The warlock uses his magic to kill the rest of the Thirteen. They reveal that they stole the dragons and have taken them to the [[House of the Undying]]. Daenerys flees in terror. Pyat Pree stops her in the entrance hall using another of his duplicates. He tells her to come to the House of the Undying to be reunited with her children. Ser Jorah\u00c2\u00a0arrives and stabs him in the back; the body disappears, and only the clothes remain. Another double reappears next to the window, again asking Daenerys why she resists.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Pyat Pree dead.jpg|thumb|Pyat Pree dies by dragonfire.]]\n\nWhen Daenerys travels to the House of the Undying to retrieve her dragons, Pyat Pree creates illusions around her as she travels throughout the House's chambers. When she reaches the room with her dragons, Pyat confronts her, saying that his magic was reborn when the dragons were born, that it is strongest in their presence, and that the dragons are strongest in hers. Using magic, he chains Daenerys, telling her she will stay with him for an eternity to fuel his magic; however, as he does this, he inadvertently provokes the dragons. Upon her saying ''[[High Valyrian|dracarys]]'', the dragons open fire on him, roasting him alive in seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valar Morghulis]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nThe warlocks of Qarth try and get revenge on Daenerys by sending an [[Unidentified Warlock|unidentified warlock]] to [[Astapor]] to assassinate her.
