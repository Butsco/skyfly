The forest extends for several hundred miles to the north, along the foothills of the mountain range known as the [[Frostfangs]], before dying out in the subarctic wastelands of the [[Lands of Always Winter]].\n\nThe forest is inhabited by tribes of [[wildlings]] who sometimes use the cover of the forest to approach the Wall and try to scale it to raid the lands to the south. The [[Night's Watch]] tries to keep the forest clear of the Wall itself, but only have the manpower to clear the woods immediately to the north of [[Castle Black]] and their other manned castles.\n\n[[Craster's Keep]] and [[White Tree]] are located within the Haunted Forest. The [[Fist of the First Men]] is located beyond its limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/castle-black/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Castle Black entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "References": "{{Reflist}}\n\n", "In the books": "[[File:Will 1x01.jpg|thumb|left|Dead wildlings in the Haunted Forest]]\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Haunted Forest has a fell reputation.
