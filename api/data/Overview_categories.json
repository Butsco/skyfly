{"attributes": {"width": "&quot;38%&quot; ", "class": "&quot;wikitable' width=&quot;100%&quot; &quot;valign=&quot;top&quot;"}, "sections": {"Using categories": "\n===Why use them?===\n\nCategories are used to group pages with similar content, thereby making it easier to connect the information gathered in the wiki. For instance: at the bottom of the page [[Winterfell]], you'll see a link that says [[:Category:Castles|Category: Castles]]. If you click on that, you'll get a list of all the castles in the wiki. At the bottom of ''that'' page, there's yet another category link: the [[:Category:Castles|Castles]] turns out to be part of a bigger group, the [[:Category:Geography|Category: Geography]]. If you click on that, you'll see that ''Geography'' is subdivided into many categories, such as [[:Category:Cities|cities]] and [[:Category:Islands|Category: Islands]]. Neat, huh?\n\nThat's why each page and each image should be labelled with '''at least one subcategory or one overall category'''.\n\nThere are three groups of categories:\n* '''Production''' categories (actors, crew, promotional videos etc.);\n* '''Story''' categories (characters, geography, culture, history etc.);\n* '''Wiki''' categories (site maintenance, help pages, blog postings, stub articles etc.).\n\n\n===When to add them?===\n\nEvery new page should have at least one category attached.\n\nDon't worry, much of the work is done for you! Many of the templates used in the wiki automatically tag a page with the appropriate category. For instance: the [[:Template:Cast|cast template]] automatically adds [[:Category:Actor|Category: Actor]] to a page, and any new actor page automatically becomes part of its overall [[:Category:Castles|Category: Crew]]. The only thing left for you to do, is to manually add a fitting subcategory, e.g. is this actor's [[:Category:Status: Active|Status: Active]], [[:Category:Status: Not hired|Status: Not hired]], or [[:Category:Status: Role ended|Status: Role ended]]?\n\n'''As a rule of thumb, you only need to add the lowest subcategory to a new page''' and the rest of the category tree gets added by itself. That's why we made this page: here you can see how categories are grouped and which parents they have. And if you're still not sure in which categories a page should be grouped, take a look at pages about a similar subject.\n\n\n===How do I add them?===\n\nTo label a page or image, you go to the bottom of the page and click on the box ''Add category''. Start typing, and the available categories will pop up. Select one of them, hit 'enter'; then select 'Save'. Done!\n\nTo make a subcategory part of an overall category: go to the subcategory page - for instance, you want to make [[:Category:Books|Category: Books]] part of the overall [[:Category:Culture &amp; Society]]- and click on the box 'Add category' at the bottom. Start typing, select the appropriate overall group, hit 'enter' and say 'Save'.\n\nBe careful when '''removing''' labels: they've been put there for a reason. But perhaps you made an error when you added a subcategory? To remove a category label, click the 'Edit' icon at the top of a page. At the bottom of your editing screen you'll see boxes with a page's category labels. Click on the little cross of the category that you wish to remove and select 'Publish'. Done!\n\n\n==[[:Category:Production|Production]]==\n\n===Overwiew===\n\n{|class=&quot;wikitable' width=&quot;100%&quot; &quot;valign=&quot;top&quot;\n|- style=&quot;background: #393939;&quot;\n| width=&quot;38%&quot;

If you're adding pages or images to the wiki, you often need to assign them a category, and it would be really nice if you take this overview into account :)\n\nThere's also a page that simply lists all the categories used in this wiki: [[:Special:Categories|list of all categories]]. And if you want to check '''how''' a specific category is used, you can use the [[:Special:CategoryTree|category tree]]. When you enter a category in the search field on that page, you'll see all its parents and all its children.\n\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! Suggestions for improvement are very, very welcome, too :-)\n\n--&gt; NOTE: Working on this page; done up to and including ''Story''. Will start working on category ''Wiki'' soon.
