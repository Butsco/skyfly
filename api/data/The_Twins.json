It is the seat of [[House Frey]], a vassal house of [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. It consists of two near-identical towers and a fortified bridge over the [[Green Fork]] of the [[River Trident]].\n\nThe Twins represents the only crossing point over the Green Fork for hundreds of miles in either direction. It is a major barrier to travelers and merchants traveling from [[the North]] to the western [[Riverlands]]. It lies directly on the main route from [[Winterfell]] to [[Riverrun]]. Moving from one castle to the other while avoiding the Twins requires a lengthy detour hundreds of miles to the south or hazardously traversing the bogs and swamps of [[the Neck]] to the north. Travelers heading south who cannot pass southwest over the Twins must pass southeast along the [[Kingsroad]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Freys' rise began six hundred years before the events of the series with the building of a stone bridge over the Green Fork. It took three generations to build the Twins, but afterwards they quickly grew wealthy by charging passing travelers for the use of the Crossing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/twins/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, The Twins entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/the-twins/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, The Twins entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is a massive arch of smooth grey stone, wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast.&lt;ref&gt;[[House Frey (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Frey was a minor house of the Riverlands until six hundred years ago. The Frey's Crossing was initially defended by wooden castles at either end. Using the wealth generated by their toll they replaced the wooden castles with strong stone ones, complete with portcullises, moats and barbicans. The bridge itself is covered and wide enough for two wagons to travel abreast. The Crossing has its own tower, named the Water Tower. House Frey's rise gained them vassal houses of their own: Houses Charlton, Erenford and Haigh.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "\nProduction Designer [[Gemma Jackson]] explained the visual aesthetic of the Twins, and the underlying reasoning behind it:\n\n:&quot;In Season 1, we built a grubby little space.  It was really old and painted and water was coming down - it was rather sinister.  We wanted to get an aspect of that again.  Because Lord Walder is mean, we did this beaten up, old leather [for the furniture].  We used his sigil on the arches - you can see very old bits of paint just coming through.  The idea is the place is getting incredibly shabby, and he doesn't want to spend any money on it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;, HBO-Go Inside-the-Episode feature&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Freys actually are a wealthy family - but they gained their wealth relatively recently, starting six years ago when they built the first bridge across the river and began exacting river tolls.  The older noble Houses of the Riverlands look down on them as upstarts.  Lord Walder became rich by being miserly, however.  He has no sense of shame, so he'd rather have a leaky roof in need of repair and worn down furniture, than spend any money on replacing them, regardless of the public appearance this to the other noble families.  He's too cheap to buy nice things.\n\nAlso, Jackson noted that the twin turret sigil of House Frey was worked into the furniture:  the corner posts of the back of Lord Walder's chair look like the two castle turrets of the Twins.\n\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nTwins long.jpg|'''The Twins''', seen from downriver\nThe Twins east tower.jpg|The eastern tower\nThe Twins looking west.jpg|The bridge and the western tower, from inside the eastern\nThe Twins Pin.png|The location of '''the Twins''' on the continent of [[Westeros]]\nThe Twins Title Sequence.jpg|as shown in the title sequence\nThe Twins 3x09.jpg|The Twins in Season 3\nThe Twins' hall in season 1.png|[[Walder Frey]]'s throne room in [[the Twins]] in &quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;\nThe Twins' hall in season 3.png|[[Walder Frey]]'s throne room in [[the Twins]] in &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;\nThe Twins' great hall in season 3.png|The great hall in [[the Twins]] in &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;\nOutside of the Twins.png|Outside [[the Twins]] in &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Notable residents of the castle": "[[File:Wooden-Twins.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original wooden Twins, and the bridge that connected them.]]\n[[File:The-Twins-under-construction.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Twins while under construction.]]\n* Lord [[Walder Frey]], known as &quot;the Late Lord Frey&quot;, the ancient lord of the castle.\n** [[Stevron Frey]], Lord Walder's firstborn son and heir.\n**Ser [[Walder Rivers]], a bastard son of Lord Walder's by a milkmaid.\n**[[Lothar Frey]], known as &quot;Lame Lothar&quot;, Lord Walder's\u00c2\u00a0son.\n**[[Walder Frey (Black Walder)|Walder Frey]], known as &quot;Black Walder&quot;, Lord Walder's great-grandson.\n** [[Olyvar Frey]], one of Lord Frey's sons, formerly squire for {[[Robb Stark]]}.\n** [[Roslin Frey]], Lord Walder's fifth daughter and Lord [[Edmure Tully]]'s wife.\n** [[Waldron Frey]], another of Lord Walder's sons, formerly betrothed to [[Arya Stark]].\n* Lady {[[Joyeuse Erenford|Joyeuse Frey]]}, Lord Frey's eighth wife.

Robb must also take [[Olyvar Frey]] as his squire, a knighthood being expected in due course. Robb accepts the deal.
