This was arranged by Lancel's cousin, Robert's wife Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]. The plan succeeded when a large boar attacked Robert but he did not react quickly enough to stop it from goring him with its tusks, mortally wounding him. Given that Robert was a well-known drunk, and no actual &quot;poison&quot; was used, this made it more difficult to suspect foul play.&lt;ref name=&quot;S1E7&quot;&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n*[[Daenerys Targaryen]] has twice been targeted with poison.
