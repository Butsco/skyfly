The fire killed both\u00c2\u00a0[[Aegon V Targaryen]] and [[Duncan Targaryen|his heir]] and is rumored to have been caused by an attempt to hatch dragon eggs.&lt;ref name=&quot;viewers guide&quot;/&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Summerhall has special significance for several members of House Targaryen. King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]] built it as a place of peace and relaxation away from court. One of his sons, Prince [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]], adopted it as his main household. Along with King Aegon V, and his heir Prince Duncan the Small many members of the Targaryen household were killed during the fire. The deaths resulted in King Jaehaerys II taking the [[Iron Throne]]. However, the fire was said to have traumatised King Jaehaerys, and he died young only two years later, leaving his son [[Aerys II Targaryen]] as King. Summerhall was also the place, where a midget woods witch, who had prophesied\u00c2\u00a0 that &quot;a promised prince&quot; would be born of Aerys and [[Rhaella Targaryen]]. Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] was likely killed in the fire as well, since Ser\u00c2\u00a0[[Gerold Hightower]]\u00c2\u00a0was [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Kingsguard]]\u00c2\u00a0the following year when [[Barristan Selmy]] joined.\n\nAerys II's own son, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], was fascinated by the ruins of Summerhall. He was born on the day that the fire took place and visited it several times.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Robert Baratheon]] killed his first man during the [[Battle of Summerhall]], a soldier of [[House Tarly]], during [[Robert's Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Summerhall"}
