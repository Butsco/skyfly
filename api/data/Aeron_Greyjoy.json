He has only appeared on the Greyjoy family tree issued by [[HBO]] to date. He is an uncle of [[Theon Greyjoy]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aeron is known as Damphair and is a [[Drowned Men|priest]] of the Drowned God. He is tall and thin with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose. He garbs himself in roughspun robes dyed in the green, grey, and blue of the Drowned God. He never cuts his hair, which falls to his waist and he weaves seaweed into it.\n\nIn his youth, Aeron was an unruly ribald drunk who often came at odds with his brother Balon. During the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], he nearly drowned when his ship was sunk by [[Stannis Baratheon]]. He washed ashore and was imprisoned at [[Lannisport]]. After being released, he had changed significantly due to his near-death experience, and became very pious and devoted to the worship of the [[Drowned God]]. He is well respected and has great influence among the [[ironborn]].\n\nAeron sometimes has nightmares about a door with screeching hinges, which he associates with his brother [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]].\n\nIn the novel, when Theon returns to the Pyke\u00c2\u00a0from the North, it is Aeron who greets him first and almost immediately baptizes him at his arrival.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "A [[Drowned Priest]] appears in the [[Season 2|second season]] but has been confirmed as not being Aeron, who may be cast for later seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2011/09/character-cuts-whos-in-and-whos-out-of-season-two/ Winter is Coming article on season 2 casting cuts]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nAeron Greyjoy is the younger brother of [[Balon Greyjoy]], head of [[House Greyjoy]] and the [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].&lt;ref&gt;http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Aeron Greyjoy"}
