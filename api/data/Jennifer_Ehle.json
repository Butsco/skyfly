Ehle played the role in the [[Pilot episode|unaired pilot episode]] filmed in late 2009, but HBO subsequently announced she was leaving the project on 19 March 2010, shortly after the series was picked up. [[Michelle Fairley]] replaced her in the role of Catelyn Stark, and Ehle's scenes from the pilot had to be redone. Initially, no official reason was given for Ehle's departure, but later messages on the Twitter website suggest it was an amicable and mutually-agreed-upon decision.
