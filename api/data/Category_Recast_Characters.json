Gregor Clegane was recast for Season 2 and yet again for Season 4. Daario Naharis was given a full introduction as a major new character in Season 3 with significant dialogue and primary interaction with Daenerys Targaryen, but was then recast. Tommen Baratheon\u00c2\u00a0had\u00c2\u00a0appeared as a third-tier character in [[Season 1]] and [[Season 2]], and was recast for Season 4 by an older actor (who had coincidentally appeared on the show briefly in a different role as Martyn Lannister in Season 3) to fit his more prominent role and mature storyline.\n\nFor [[Season 5]], [[Myrcella Baratheon]] was likewise recast after appearing in Seasons 1 and 2 as a third-tier character.\n\n[[Beric Dondarrion]] and [[Rickard Karstark]] were more of &quot;placeholders&quot; before their main introduction in later seasons, however, they did have speaking lines and were also credited, so they count as &quot;recast&quot;.\n\nSort of a gray area are characters who were initially played by uncredited extras, then officially cast and introduced. For example, the first [[High Septon (Before the riot of King's Landing)]] technically appeared in Season 1, but with no speaking lines and not identified as &quot;the High Septon&quot; except by his costume. Similarly, [[Selyse Baratheon]] technically appeared in the Season 2 premiere, but only appeared in a crowd shot, had no speaking lines, nor was she identified; we only know from casting information that this was actually supposed to be Selyse. Given that we want to avoid confusing TV-first viewers, we'll avoid complicating matters and ''not'' include either of these two under &quot;recast&quot; characters. TV-first viewers wouldn't even know that these characters had appeared unless we pointed it out.\n\nFor the time being, [[Jaqen H'ghar]] of the [[Faceless Men]] will not be considered to be a &quot;recast&quot; character. A hooded figure did appear in the prisoner cart during the Season 1 finale, uncredited, but this was another &quot;placeholder&quot; before his full introduction in Season 2. Considering his face-change in the Season 2 finale, it was still ''voiced'' by the same actor and the different face was an in-universe aspect.\n[[Category:Production]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}, "title": "Category:Recast Characters"}
