In Westeros ultimate power derives from the King on the [[Iron Throne]] and descends through the [[Great Houses]] that rule the constituent regions of the continent to their vassals.\n\nThere are nine [[Great Houses]], and each of them have a number of [[:Category:Vassal houses|vassal houses]] (sometimes also referred to as '''lesser houses''') in their liege. The most powerful vassal houses may themselves field armies of a few thousand and control large regions, while the smallest houses may be little more than impoverished landholders with only a few men to their name. Members of the nobility are called &quot;highborn&quot;, in contrast to lowborn commoners.\n\nSome of the most powerful noble Houses rival the smaller Great Houses in terms of wealth and the size of the armies they can field, i.e. [[House Hightower]] rules [[Oldtown]], the second largest city in Westeros, and possesses large armies and fleets of its own.  Other noble Houses, while technically holding this rank, are relatively poor.  \n\nA typical noble house is seated at a castle and controls the land around it, collecting tithes and taxes from farmers, lesser landholders and [[smallfolk]]. In times of war they are expected to recruit and maintain a number of soldiers for their lieges. In most of Westeros only men can become ruling lords, and women can only rule if the rest of the male line has been extinguished or if they are acting as regents for their sons until they become of majority.\n\nIn [[Dorne]] men and women have equal property, inheritance and ruling rights.\n\n"}, "title": "Noble house"}
