In the books, this occurred on the docks of Qarth as she was leaving, but the TV series moved it forward slightly to occur in Astapor, soon after Dany arrives from Qarth. In the books, the would-be assassin is not a Warlock but a Sorrowful Man, an ancient guild of assassins in Qarth known for whispering &quot;I am so sorry&quot; to their victims before killing them. It is not known who orders the attempt on Dany's life, as several Qartheen factions have called for her death by this time in the narrative, though the Warlocks have a special interest in Daenerys' death after her dragons kill their leaders, the Undying Ones, when she tries to leave from the [[House of the Undying]].\n\n", "TOP": "Unidentified Warlock014479a31kjbhin6cx5lb0yhg13fy0or870dt1414462014-06-08T10:17:50Z101.175.163.218/* In the books */ \r\nGrammar- changed &quot;attempt of Dany's life&quot; to &quot;attempt on Dany's life&quot;{{Character\n| Title=Unidentified Warlock\n| Image=Unidentified_warlock_S3_Ep1.png\n| Season=[[Season 3|3]]\n| Appearances=&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;\n| Mentioned=\n| Aka=\n| Status=[[:Category:Status: Alive|Alive]]\n| Death=\n| Place=[[Qarth]]\n| Allegiance=[[Warlocks]]\n| Family=\n| Actor=[[Lottie Steer]]}}\n\nAn '''&quot;Unidentified Warlock&quot;''' is an assassin played by [[Lottie Steer]] first seen in &quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;.
