He is deceased when the events of the series begin. He was scheduled to appear in the [[Season 1|first season]] in flashback in a scene that was filmed, but later dropped for time reasons. Brandon Stark was the heir of [[Rickard Stark]], the [[Lord of Winterfell]], and the older brother of [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]], [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] and [[Benjen Stark]]. He was [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|killed]] by the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] when he protested the [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapping]] of Lyanna by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Brandon was rather hot-blooded, something his younger brother described as coming from the wolfblood. He shared this trait with his sister. [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] believes this led them both to an early death. Brandon was tall and handsome, and was an excellent swordsman and jouster.\n\nIn his youth, Brandon was fostered at [[Barrowton]] with Lord [[House Dustin|Dustin]], father of Willam Dustin, but he spent most his time riding in [[the Rills]]. Brandon and his sister [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] both loved to ride; Lady Dustin compares them to &quot;a couple of centaurs&quot;. Brandon also enjoyed practicing sword-play, and loved his sword. In his youth, he took the maidenhead of [[Barbrey Ryswell]], who was infatuated with him. When he was fifteen, he was promised to [[Catelyn Tully]] of [[Riverrun]], who was twelve at the time. Barbrey claims that Brandon never wanted to marry Catelyn and that the match was made when Lord [[Rickard Stark|Rickard]]'s maester, Walys Flowers, put the idea in Rickard's head.\n\nShortly after the confrontation between Brandon and Littlefinger mentioned above, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] kidnapped Lyanna Stark. Brandon and a group of close friends, all sons of powerful lords, rode to [[King's Landing]] to seek redress from King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. The Mad King, furious that anyone would question his son's actions, took Brandon prisoner and summoned Lord Rickard to answer for his impertinence. He had both Starks executed: Rickard was cooked alive in his armor by pyromancers led by [[Wisdom]] [[Rossart]], while Brandon watched, bound with a leather cord around his neck and a longsword just out of reach, strangling himself trying to get to the sword to save his father.\n\nBrandon's brother Eddard became Lord of Winterfell, married Catelyn Tully in his stead, and raised the banners of rebellion, beginning a [[Robert's Rebellion|bloody civil war]] that ended with deaths of both Prince Rhaegar and the Mad King.\n\nIn the books, Brandon was described as a larger and more handsome man than his younger brother Ned. The TV series makes a departure from this, with [[Petyr Baelish]] stating that Eddard is an &quot;even more impressive specimen&quot; than his older brother - though it's possible that Littlefinger meant that Eddard was also a much better partner for marriage (Brandon had a fiery temper and was known as the &quot;Wild Wolf&quot;, while Eddard was reserved and dignified).\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "[[File:Brandon's execution.jpg|thumb|right|King Aerys II Targaryen watches as Brandon Stark strangles himself.]]\nAn unidentified actor was cast to play Brandon in a flashback scene. Footage of the scene appeared in the &quot;Fear and Blood&quot; first season trailer but has not appeared in any aired episode of the series. The scene was cut for time reasons.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Brandon Stark}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\n[[File:Rickard arrest.png|thumb|left|Rickard and Brandon are arrested by Targaryen guards.]]\nBrandon Stark was the eldest son and heir of Lord [[Rickard Stark]].

Brandon defended Catelyn's honor in a duel with [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish]]. He defeated Baelish easily, nearly disemboweling him in the process, but Catelyn begged Brandon to spare his life.  The maesters were able to save Baelish and he eventually recovered, but he was left with a deep scar running from his stomach to his collarbone (under his clothes), a &quot;token&quot; from Brandon that Baelish would always carry with him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Aerys Rickard Brandon.png|thumb|260px|Brandon strangles himself trying to save his father.]]Brandon was [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|killed]] on the order of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]], along with his father, after they protested the [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapping]] of Lyanna by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]].
