Their lands are located within the Dornish Marches, a region of the [[Stormlands]] that lies to the north of [[Dorne]]. Their castle is called [[Blackhaven]] and the head of the house is the [[Lord of Blackhaven]].\n\nHouse Dondarrion is ruled by Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]], a charismatic and popular young lord, noted for his skill at [[tourneys]]. House Dondarrion's sigil is a forked purple lightning bolt on a black sky speckled with four-pointed stars.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Dondarrion was founded by a messenger who brought word of an impending attack by Dorne to the Storm King. The messenger was attacked by two Dornishmen, but a freak bolt of lightning killed both of them, allowing the messenger to complete his task.\n\nA century before the events of the series, House Dondarrion was charged by the King to root out a bandit warlord known as the Vulture King, who had established a hideaway in the [[Red Mountains]]. The Dondarrions, allied to the neighboring [[House Caron]] of [[Nightsong]], took eight hundred horse and four thousand foot soldiers into the mountains to complete the mission. Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] took part in this mission as a small boy and squire to Ser Arlan of Pennytree.\n\nLord Beric Dondarrion is young, handsome and popular, known for his valor, steadfastness and reliability.\n\n", "Members": "* Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]], the ruling lord of the house.
