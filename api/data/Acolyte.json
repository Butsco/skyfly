It is the middle rank within the order, above [[Apprentice]] and below [[Wisdom]].\n\nAcolytes are tasked with preparing [[wildfire]], which the members of the Guild call &quot;the Substance&quot; in bare stone cells, using the order's secret arts and methods, which Wisdoms boast is &quot;ancient magic&quot;. Should an Acolyte accidentally allow the wildfire to ignite, the ceiling of the cell is 'spelled' to collapse and release a large mass of sand to quell the fire - and bury the careless Acolyte alive.\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Alchemists' Guild]]"}, "title": "Acolyte"}
