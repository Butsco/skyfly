Torrhen's Square is under siege.|Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] to Prince [[Bran Stark]]|The Ghost of Harrenhal}}\nThe '''Raid on Torrhen's Square''' is a battle during the [[War of the Five Kings]]. It is part of a ploy by [[Theon Greyjoy]] - who had abandoned [[House Stark]] and aligned himself with his father [[Balon Greyjoy]], the self-fashioned [[King of the Iron Islands]] - to seize [[Winterfell]] and gain the respect of his father and fellow [[ironborn]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the books, the attack on Torrhen's Square is led personally by [[Dagmer Cleftjaw]]. He is driven away by Ser Rodrik Cassel and men from [[House Cerwyn]] back to the [[Stony Shore]]. After Rodrik returns to [[Winterfell]] in attempt to free it, Dagmer and his men return to Torrhen's Square and take it. Currently they are still there.\n\n", "History": "===Prelude and battle===\nAfter news of an unidentified party attacking [[Torrhen's Square]] reach Winterfell, Prince [[Bran Stark]] sends [[Rodrik Cassel]] to defend the Stark bannermen of [[House Tallhart]].\n\n===Aftermath===\nWith Winterfell undefended, Theon leads his crew to Winterfell and [[Fall of Winterfell|seizes it]]. In the meantime, Ser Rodrik is defeated and captured by the ironborn.\n\n"}, "title": "Raid on Torrhen's Square"}
