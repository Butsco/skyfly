It trades with the slaver cities of [[Meereen]], [[Yunkai]] and [[Astapor]] to the east.\n\nElyria, Tolos, and Mantarys are the only three surviving cities on the [[Valyrian Peninsula]], each in the northern sections not too close to Valyria itself when the Doom struck.  They were colonies ruled directly by governors from the Valyrian Freehold, not Free Cities that had purchased contracts for some limited rule over local affairs.  After the Doom, because they were located on the east coast, Elyria and Tolos developed developed closer ties with the Ghiscari cities of Slaver's Bay to the east, and fell into their cultural orbit. Mantarys, however, is located far from the coast, up in the foothills of the Painted Mountains, and as a result it became increasingly isolated.\n\n"}, "title": "Elyria"}
