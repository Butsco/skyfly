He is played by starring cast member [[Sean Bean]], and debuts in the [[Winter is Coming|series premiere]].\n\nEddard is the head of [[House Stark]] and [[Lord Paramount of the North]]. He is a dedicated husband and father, a loyal friend and an honorable lord. Eddard becomes [[Hand of the King]] to his lifelong friend, [[Robert Baratheon]], when the previous hand dies in suspicious circumstances. He follows his predecessor's footsteps and uncovers an incestuous relationship between Queen, [[Cersei Lannister]], and her brother, Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]. Robert dies after being injured while hunting and Eddard challenges the legitimacy of his successor, [[Joffrey Baratheon]], but\u00c2\u00a0is betrayed by his political allies and arrested for [[treason]]. He confesses to the crime to protect his family, but is nevertheless [[Execution of Eddard Stark|executed]] due to Joffrey's impulsive\u00c2\u00a0sadism. The conflict between House Stark and [[House Lannister]] sets the stage for the [[War of the Four Kings|War of the Five Kings]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Eddard Stark is in his mid-thirties when the story begins. He has a reputation for chivalry, honor, honesty and command, but can also sometimes be remote. He has a frosty relationship with Ser Jaime Lannister, believing that the latter should have been, at the very least, stripped of his rank in the Kingsguard for his murder of the former king. A stoic yet fair and caring man, Eddard puts a great deal of importance on his family.\n\nKing Robert traveled to Winterfell to ask Eddard to replace Arryn as Hand of the King, the monarch's closest adviser. Ned wanted to decline, but went south at his wife's urging to investigate Arryn's death. He eventually discovered that Cersei and Jaime were lovers and Cersei's three children were Jaime's, not Robert's. Ned warned Cersei to flee the city, but instead she remained while Robert was mortally wounded on a boar hunt. When Ned attempted to expose the truth of Joffrey's parentage, his men were executed and he was captured due to the treachery of Littlefinger. He was executed on the order of King Joffrey.\n\nEddard is also an accomplished battlefield commander, leading armies in Robert's Rebellion and the Greyjoy Rebellion.\n\nUnlike the show, Ned's bones are sent to Riverrun as part of a plot orchestrated by Tyrion Lannister to free his brother Jaime. Afterward a retinue of Stark men are sent to deliver them to Winterfell. However, with [[Moat Cailin]] held by the [[ironborn]], the whereabouts of the retinue and their cargo remains unknown.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|I don't fight in [[tournament]]s because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.|'''Eddard''' to [[Jaime Lannister|Ser Jaime Lannister]]|Winter is Coming}}\n{{Quote|I followed you into war.

Jon's presence at Winterfell is a source of friction between Eddard and his wife.\n\nEddard is the second son of Lord [[Rickard Stark]]. Lord Rickard served King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] as Warden of the North. Eddard's older brother [[Brandon Stark (Son of Rickard)|Brandon]] was Rickard's heir.

The direwolf was survived by her litter of six pups. Eddard's first instinct is to kill them, but Jon argues that as the direwolf is the sigil of [[House Stark]], this may be an omen. Eddard agrees to let his children look after them on the condition that they clean, raise and feed them with no help from the servants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter&quot; /&gt;\n\nA [[raven]] bears news of the death of [[Jon Arryn]], Eddard's childhood mentor, to Winterfell. The missive also states that [[King Robert]] and much of the royal court is on their way to the castle. Eddard realizes that Robert means to name him as [[Hand of the King]] to replace Jon. He ponders refusing, but when Robert arrives he makes it clear that he badly needs Eddard's help in [[King's Landing]]. He also sweetens the deal by offering to betrothe his son and heir [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] to Eddard's daughter [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. Eddard remains uncertain until a secret letter from [[Lysa Arryn]], [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]'s sister, implicates the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] in the death of Jon Arryn. Eddard decides to accept to investigate both Jon's death and a potential plot against the king. He decides to bring both of his daughters to introduce them to the court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter&quot; /&gt;\n\nBran is found comatose at the base of a disused tower following an apparent climbing accident. Eddard reluctantly decides to leave as planned, to his wife's distress. Eddard, [[Arya]], Sansa and the royal party head south to [[King's Landing]]. At their parting Eddard tells Jon that, though he does not have Eddard's name, he has his blood. He also promises Jon to tell him about his mother the next time they meet.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Eddard and Jon.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Eddard and his son Jon Snow.]]\nOn the [[Kingsroad]] south to the capital, King Robert calls a halt to discuss troubling news from [[Essos]]. Robert's spies have learned of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s marriage to Khal [[Drogo]], whose ''[[khalasar]]'' is reported to number over one hundred thousand warriors. Eddard points out that the [[Dothraki]] cannot cross the [[Narrow Sea]], as they have no ships, but Robert is concerned that the Seven Kingdoms will soon face another war. Robert also asks about\u00c2\u00a0Wylla, the mother of Jon Snow, but Eddard quickly deflects the line of questioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Ned and Arya.jpg|thumb|210px|Eddard and Arya at the Crossroads Inn.]]\n[[File:Eddard &amp; Lady.jpg|thumb|left|Eddard before he executes Sansa's direwolf, Lady.]]\nJoffrey is mauled by Arya's direwolf [[Nymeria]] after he attacks Arya. Arya then forces Nymeria to flee and hides in the woods. Arya is found and Eddard is brought before the king and instructed to punish Arya. Joffrey lies about the cause of the incident and Sansa supports him, enraging Arya. [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] insists that a direwolf must be punished and Robert orders that Sansa's direwolf, [[Lady]], must be killed in Nymeria's place. Eddard attends to the matter himself, to Sansa's anger.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt;\n\nOn his arrival in King's Landing, Eddard is immediately summoned to a [[small council]] meeting and finds the capital immersed in political intrigue. Members of the king's [[small council]] are at the heart of these machinations: [[Petyr Baelish]], the [[master of coin]], known as Littlefinger; [[Varys]], the [[master of whisperers]]; [[Pycelle]], the [[Grand Maester]]; and [[Renly Baratheon]], the [[master of laws]] and Robert's younger brother. Eddard learns that the crown is six million [[gold dragons]] in debt with half of it owed to Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. Robert has ordered a lavish [[tournament]] to celebrate Eddard's appointment regardless. While acclimating to the political manoeuvring, Eddard also tries to repair the rift between Sansa and Arya, with mixed results. Sansa rejects his gifts, but Arya is delighted when he hires a swordmaster, [[Syrio Forel]], to train her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snow&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLittlefinger tells Eddard that Catelyn has followed him to the city. Eddard is furious when Littlefinger brings him to a brothel, believing he is being made to look a fool. Catelyn intervenes as Eddard attacks Littlefinger. She tells Eddard that she has traveled south to report that an assassination attempt against Bran. The assassin was killed but was carrying a Valyrian steel knife. Littlefinger identifies the blade as one that he lost in a bet with [[Tyrion Lannister]] and they conclude that the Lannisters were also behind Bran's original injuries. Eddard agrees to try to expose the truth and Catelyn urges him to trust Littlefinger, her childhood friend. Eddard reluctantly agrees, though he finds Littlefinger obnoxious and dishonorable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snow&quot; /&gt;\n\nEddard's investigation reveals that Jon Arryn took an interest in Robert's numerous bastard children, including his son [[Gendry]]. He learns that Jon borrowed ''[[The Lineage and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' from Pycelle. Eddard reads the book but cannot determine why Jon wanted it. Eddard discovers that soon after Jon's death his squire, [[Hugh]], was knighted. Eddard sends the captain of his guards, [[Jory Cassel]], to investigate but Hugh refuses to talk to Jory. Hugh is killed by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] - a noted servant of Lord Tywin Lannister - in an apparent tourney mishap before Eddard can talk to him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As the tourney continues, Eddard discusses the death with [[Lord Commander]] [[Barristan Selmy]] of the [[Kingsguard]], one of the most decorated and honorable knights in Westeros. They cannot ascertain if Hugh was killed deliberately. Eddard convinces King Robert not to fight in the tourney, bluntly calling him too fat. Robert reluctantly agrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lion&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Yoren]] of the Night's Watch arrives in the city and tells Eddard that he witnessed Catelyn arresting Tyrion Lannister. This allows Eddard to claim that he ordered the arrest. Varys visits Eddard and warns him that there is a conspiracy, saying that Jon was poisoned and that King Robert may also be killed if Eddard cannot unearth and stop it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lion&quot; /&gt;\n\nA rift is opened between Eddard and Robert when Eddard refuses to sanction the assassination of Daenerys. Eddard resigns as Hand and prepares to return to Winterfell. Littlefinger gives Eddard another lead, keeping him in the city. Eddard finds another of Robert's bastards, a baby girl named [[Barra]] in one of Littlefinger's brothels. As Eddard leaves the brothel, he is confronted by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] over Tyrion's capture. Jaime kills Jory and Eddard's other bodyguards and engages Eddard in single combat. A Lannister guardsman interferes and stabs Eddard in the leg, angering Jaime. He tells Eddard that he wants his brother back and leaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lion&quot; /&gt;\n\nAn injured Eddard wakes up in the [[Red Keep]] to be confronted by Cersei and Robert about the fight with Jaime and the abduction of Tyrion by Catelyn. Cersei is enraged that Eddard will not be punished. Robert tells Eddard that he is like a brother, and he refuses to accept his resignation as Hand. Robert commands Eddard to take back the badge and to make peace with the Lannisters, as he will not risk another civil war. Eddard reluctantly agrees. Robert goes on a hunting expedition, and Eddard receives word that Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] is leading a series of pillaging raids on the [[Riverlands]], possibly at Lord Tywin Lannister's command. Despite his order to make peace with the Lannisters, Eddard commands Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] to carry out an order of execution on Gregor, whom he [[Attainting|strips]] of all rank and title. Eddard also orders that Tywin present himself in the capital to explain his vassal's actions under penalty of being branded a traitor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot;&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDespite being restored to the king's favor, Eddard worries that the situation may yet come to war. He orders Sansa and Arya to return to Winterfell. A chance comment by Sansa that golden-haired Joffrey is a lion, not a stag, and is &quot;nothing like&quot; his old drunk of a father, makes Eddard realize the truth. He consults ''The Lineage'' book and sees that in every match between a Baratheon and a member of another house, the Baratheon black hair always dominates. He realizes with shock that this means that Joffrey and the other royal children are not Robert's and have no claim to the [[Iron Throne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Eddard and Cersei 1x07.png|thumb|Eddard confronts Cersei.]]\nEddard confronts Cersei and warns her that he knows that her three children are the product of her incestuous relationship with Jaime. He warns her to flee into exile before Robert returns from his hunt, when he will tell Robert the truth. Robert is mortally wounded while on the hunt. Wishing him a peaceful death, Eddard withholds his discovery. Robert names Eddard [[Protector of the Realm]], to rule until [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] comes of age. Eddard transcribes the command as referring to Robert's rightful heir, not mentioning Joffrey by name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Win&quot;&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEddard writes to Robert's brother and true heir, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], urging him to take the crown. He dispatches his guardsman [[Tomard]] to deliver the letter. He tells Littlefinger the truth of the matter, but rejects Littlefinger's suggestion that they take advantage of the situation to increase their own power. Reluctantly, Littlefinger agrees to recruit the [[City Watch]] to Eddard's cause. Renly also offers Eddard the use of soldiers in securing Cersei and her children, but Eddard refuses to dishonor Robert's last few hours by spilling blood and frightening children. Renly flees the castle fearing that the Lannisters will show no such respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Win&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Eddard and Petyr 1x07.png|thumb|left|Littlefinger turns on Eddard Stark.]]\nRobert dies and Joffrey takes the throne. Cersei tears up the letter proclaiming Eddard as Protector of the Realm. Eddard tells Joffrey that he has no right to the Iron Throne and commands the City Watch to take him and his mother into custody. Instead, the City Watch turns on Eddard's men and kills them. Littlefinger holds a knife to Eddard's throat, telling him that he shouldn't have trusted him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Win&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Ned 1x09.png|thumb|Eddard in the black cells of the Red Keep.]]\nEddard is incarcerated in the black cells under the Red Keep. He is visited by Varys who is disguised as a gaoler. Varys is bemused by Eddard telling Cersei that he knew about the parentage of her children and adds that his mercy is what killed Robert. He also informs Ned says that Catelyn no longer has Tyrion in custody. Eddard asks if he will be killed and Varys replies, &quot;Not today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Varys returns to urge Eddard to confess to treason in exchange for exile in the [[Night's Watch]]. Eddard refuses until Varys elucidates that the Lannisters still have Sansa as a hostage - Arya has escaped. Varys adds that the Lannisters need him alive so they can bargain with his son Robb, who is leading an army to confront them in the [[Riverlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bae&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Ned's execution.jpg|thumb|left|Eddard is executed by Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] in &quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;.]]\nEddard is taken to the front steps of the\u00c2\u00a0[[Great Sept of Baelor]]. He spots Arya crouching beside the statue of [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]]\u00c2\u00a0and signals [[Yoren]], who is also present amidst the gathered crowd.
