He is played by [[Fintan McKeown]] and debuts in &quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]].&quot; Ser Amory Lorch is a knight fighting for [[House Lannister]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. He was killed by [[Jaqen H'ghar]] at [[Harrenhal]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Amory Lorch is a noted servant of Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] and a member of House Lorch, a knightly house sworn to Casterly Rock. During the [[Sack of King's Landing]] at the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]], Ser Amory Lorch and Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] were assigned to eliminate the last scions of [[House Targaryen]], breaking into the royal apartments and brutally killing Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]'s wife, [[Elia Martell]], and their children, [[Aegon Targaryen (Son of Rhaegar)|Aegon]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]], an act that has marred the reputation of both.\n\nLorch killed Rhaenys by stabbing her about fifty times. Even Tywin considered that the manner was overly brutal. He asked Lorch why killing a four year old girl required so many thrusts, and Lorch answered that she kicked him and would not stop screaming. Tywin commented that if Lorch had half the brain a turnip has, he would have calmed Rhaenys with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow to smother her. In the TV-series it wasn't mentioned that he was involved in the killing of Rhaenys and her murder is attributed to Gregor Clegane.\n\nIn the books, Ser Amory comes into conflict with Yoren while hunting down the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] instead of [[Gendry]]. Although Yoren repeatedly assures Lorch that his caravan has nothing to do with the Brotherhood, Lorch picks a fight with him without any provocation or reason.\n\nThere is no mention in the books that Lorch is illiterate.\n\nLorch is not one of the names Arya gives to Jaqen, and was not killed by him. After [[Roose Bolton]] took [[Harrenhal]], he and [[Locke|Vargo Hoat]] had Lorch thrown into the bear pit, where he was torn apart. Arya considered that poetic punishment for Yoren's death, as she had thought of Yoren as hairy and tough like a bear.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nAmory-lorch.jpg|Ser Amory Lorch  at the HBO viewer's guide.\nAmory 2x03.jpg|Ser Amory in Lannister armor in &quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]].&quot;\nTywin berates Lorch.jpg|Tywin Lannister berates Amory Lorch for misdirecting his letter in &quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;.\nAmory chases Arya.jpg|Ser Amory chasing Arya in &quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]].&quot;\nAmory assassinated.jpg|Ser Amory dead in &quot;The Old Gods and the New.&quot;\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season Two Appearances|||yes|yes|yes|yes}}\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nSer Amory Lorch is a landed [[knight]] of [[House Lorch]], a knightly house sworn to [[House Lannister]].

They have been run off by [[Yoren]] and his [[Night's Watch]] recruits who are harboring the boy. Lorch confronts Yoren's group and [[Raid by the Gods Eye|attacks]] them when they refuse to give up Gendry. He kills [[Yoren]] personally after his men have subdued him and then imprisons the survivors, ordering them to be taken to [[Harrenhal]]. He does not realize that [[Arya Stark]] and [[Gendry]] are among them. He questions them about Gendry and is tricked into believing that the slain [[Lommy Greenhands]] was his target because he was carrying Gendry's bull's head helm.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLorch and his men deliver the prisoners to Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] at Harrenhal. Ser Gregor oversees the torture of the captives, killing several of them. When Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] returns to Harrenhal he ends the interrogations and orders the prisoners put to work, criticizing his men for wasting valuable manpower.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLorch attends a war council held by Lord Tywin. Tywin criticizes his men for underestimating [[Robb Stark]] and demands that they devise a new strategy. Lorch reports rumors from spies that there is discontent in Robb's camp. Tywin is dismissive, saying that discontent is a part of war and that the very same spies would report the same from the Lannister side.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSer Amory is chastised by Lord Tywin during a war council after the knight's illiteracy means that a letter meant for Lord [[Damon Marbrand|Damon]] of [[House Marbrand]] is instead accidentally sent to [[Marlin Dormund|Lord Marlin]] of [[House Dormund]], a vassal of [[House Stark]]. Exasperated, Tywin remarks that &quot;my [[cupbearer]] reads better than you!&quot; Later, Amory catches [[Arya Stark]] with a stolen letter and tries to seize her, and then heads to inform Tywin. Frantically, Arya seeks out\u00c2\u00a0the assassin [[Jaqen H'ghar]] and names Amory as her next kill. Ser Amory is killed with a poisoned dart dipped in [[wolfsbane]] just as he enters Lord Tywin's chambers. Tywin mistakes it for an assassination attempt on himself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Amory Lorch"}
