Keep him as a hostage.|[[Catelyn Stark]] to [[Robb Stark]]|Kissed by Fire}}\n\nA '''Hostage''' or '''Captive''' is a member of a [[noble house]] that is held against their will by another noble house or organization. Some hostages are imprisoned if considered dangerous or if there is risk that they may escape (with or without outside help). Others are awarded the courtesy and privileges of nobility and given relatively free run of the castles or keeps they are captive in. In the case of children, these hostages often become no different from [[ward]]s to their captors.\n\nIn times of war, hostages are taken and kept alive to use later in political negotiations or in exchange for ransom. Such prisoners are usually only held until the war is over. As a high-profile hostage can be an important bargaining chip, it is considered impolitic for their captors to harm them.\n\nIn peace time, specially after the end of a war or rebellion, long-term political hostages are taken to ensure the good behavior of a captive's relative or retainers, under penalty of torment or death for the hostage.\n\n", "Known hostages": "*[[Theon Greyjoy]]: taken hostage after the [[Siege of Pyke|failure]] of the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] and raised as a ward of [[House Stark]].
