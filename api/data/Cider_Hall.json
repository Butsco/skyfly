Steffon had previously promised to support Duncan and then betrayed him. Furious at this dishonorable action, his squire and cousin Raymun volunteered to take the side of Ser Duncan. Ser Lyonel Baratheon knighted Raymun. During the resulting melee, Ser Raymun bested Ser Steffon in combat. To avoid confusion on the battlefield, Ser Raymun took a green apple as his sign.\n\nFor later services, the green apple Fossoways descended from Ser Raymun became lords in their own right, establishing a keep and lands at New Barrel.\n\n"}, "title": "Cider Hall"}
