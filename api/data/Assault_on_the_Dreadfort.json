Yara kills a Bolton guard and takes another hostage, demanding to know where Theon is. The guard reveals Theon is in the kennels and is promptly killed.\n\nAs the castle garrison becomes aware of the invaders and the alarm is sounded, Yara finds Theon inside a kennel cage. He refuses to leave with his sister, fearing its another of Ramsay's mind games and insisting that he's &quot;Reek&quot;. Soon, a group of Bolton men led by Ramsay arrives at the kennels. As the Northmen and ironborn fight and kill each other, Yara tries to drag the resisting Theon with her. Theon bites her hand and returns to his cage. Ramsay then releases his [[Bastard's girls|hounds]] on Yara and the few surviving ironborn.\n\nYara and the surviving ironborn flee the Dreadfort and return to their boat. She now considers Theon to be dead.\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{Quote|My brother is dead.|Yara Greyjoy|The Laws of Gods and Men}}\nAs a reward for his demonstration of loyalty and &quot;love&quot;, Ramsay rewards Reek with a bath, cleaning his pet himself.
