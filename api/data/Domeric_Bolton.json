According to Roose, Domeric was quiet but accomplished; he read history, played the harp and rode as if born on the saddle. Lady [[Barbrey Dustin]], his maternal aunt, was quite fond of Domeric, who had served as a page at [[Barrowton]]. He also served as a squire for Lord [[Redfort]]\u00c2\u00a0in the [[Vale]], who said Domeric had the makings of a tournament champion. Domeric enjoyed the company of Redfort's sons in the Vale and, longing for a brother of his own, went to seek out his [[Ramsay Snow|bastard half-brother]]\u00c2\u00a0while returning from the Vale to the Dreadfort, despite his father's express command not to.\n\nAccording to the Boltons' maester, Uthor, Domeric died of a sickness of the bowels. Roose\u00c2\u00a0however believes that Ramsay poisoned Domeric\u00c2\u00a0in order to take his place as\u00c2\u00a0their father's heir.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "Domeric Bolton has only been indirectly mentioned by [[Iwan Rheon]] in press interviews&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfGTNmgJ9Q8 Flicks And The City]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesshollywood.com/game-of-thrones-season-3-iwan-rheon-talks-finally-revealing-the-name-of-the-boy-torturing-theon-greyjoy_article_80540 Access Hollywood]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George R.R.
