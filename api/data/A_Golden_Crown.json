He finds both King Robert and [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] waiting. Cersei is furious with Eddard's acts in having her brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrested and attacking Jaime in the street. She wants Robert to take action against him, but Robert refuses to condemn him without hearing Eddard's side, and tells her to be silent. When Cersei protests further, and calls Robert a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. He tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and Cersei leaves in anger. Afterwards, Robert restores Eddard to his position as [[King's Hand]], and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to Jaime Lannister. He tells Lord Eddard to end the animosity between [[House Stark]] and [[House Lannister]], as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war. He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns.\n\n[[Image:Stiv and Osha.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Stiv]] and [[Osha]] accost [[Bran Stark|Bran]] near [[Winterfell]].]]\nIn [[Winterfell]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] has another dream about the [[three-eyed raven]], in which it flies into the castle's crypts. He wakes up to find that [[Hodor]] has brought the finished saddle designed by Tyrion. He goes on a ride with [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]. They have had word from King's Landing about Eddard's injury, [[Jory Cassel|Jory]]'s death and Tyrion's capture. Theon thinks that Robb should prepare [[the North]] for war, but Robb is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come, and until then will follow his parents' orders to remain in Winterfell. They\u00c2\u00a0discover that Bran has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him. Robb finds a group of [[Free Folk|wildlings]]\u00c2\u00a0threatening Bran and trying to steal his horse. Robb kills two, but another wildling holds Bran with a knife to the throat. Theon shoots him from behind, angering Robb by endangering Bran. The remaining wildling, a woman named [[Osha]], yields and begs for her life. Robb agrees to take her as a prisoner.\n\n[[Image:Tyrion and Mord.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s verbal skills are wasted on [[Mord]].]]\nIn the Eyrie, Tyrion almost rolls out of his sky cell in his sleep, to his consternation. He tries to make a bargain with the gaoler, [[Mord]], to no avail.\n\nIn King's Landing,\u00c2\u00a0[[Arya Stark|Arya]] has another [[Water Dance|&quot;dancing&quot;]] lesson with [[Syrio Forel]], but isn't in the mood due to Jory's death. Syrio tells her that she may need to fight at any time, not just when she's in the mood. He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness.\n\n[[Image:Tyrion on trial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tyrion on trial in [[the Eyrie]].]]\nTyrion convinces Mord to carry a message to Lady [[Lysa Arryn]] and, in exchange, he will give Mord the gold he had with him when he was captured. Lysa summons Tyrion, believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit, but all he confesses to is being a liar, a whoremonger, and a player of practical jokes. He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder. However, Tyrion uses the opportunity of his audience in front of Lysa's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial, and Lysa is shamed into agreeing. Given that Lysa's son is a young boy and wouldn't make a good judge in a formal trial, Tyrion instead demands a [[trial by combat]], which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right. Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat, she asks for a volunteer to be her champion, and Ser [[Vardis Egen]] agrees. Egen is unwilling to fight Tyrion however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable. Tyrion names his own champion: his brother Jaime, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. At this Lysa does object, as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present. Tyrion desperately asks for volunteers, and after a long pause during which it seems that Tyrion's cause is lost, the [[Mercenary|sellsword]] Bronn steps forward and says he will stand for him.\n\n[[Image:Robert's hunting party.jpg|thumb|right|200px|King Robert's hunting party.]]\nKing Robert is out hunting, accompanied by his brother [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and [[Lancel Lannister]]. Robert, being supplied with wine by Lancel, becomes drunk and nostalgic, longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition (instead of being hidden schemers). Robert brags about all the women he has bedded, but Renly becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women. Renly calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that Robert is conveniently ignoring. Renly storms off, leaving Ser Barristan to look on concerned, as Lancel keeps up King Robert's wine supply.\n\nIn King's Landing, at a meeting of the [[small council]], a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed. Eddard hears tales of a huge knight ravaging [[the Riverlands]]. He realizes that it's Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], &quot;The Mountain&quot;, who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the Riverlands - which are held by [[House Tully]], the former House of his wife Catelyn, who now holds Tyrion captive. Even though King Robert told him to make peace with the Lannisters, Lord Eddard could not bring himself to let this injustice stand. Eddard strips Gregor Clegane of his knighthood, land, and titles, and sends Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] with a retinue of one hundred [[Knighthood|knights]] to arrest and execute him in the king's name. He also orders Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] to send word to [[Casterly Rock]], demanding Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]'s presence in court to explain his bannerman's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. 'Littlefinger' [[Petyr Baelish]], and Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and Eddard's actions against the Lannisters, but Eddard wants to see justice done.                        \n[[Image:Bronn defeats Vardis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bronn]] kicks Ser [[Vardis Egen]]'s corpse out of the Moon Door.]]\nIn the Eyrie, Bronn [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|does battle]] with Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen. Bronn fights defensively, waiting for Vardis to tire, as unlike Bronn he is dressed in full armor. Bronn finally gets his chance; he first wounds and then kills Vardis, sending his body rolling out of the &quot;Moon Door&quot; that leads to a thousand-foot drop. Lysa complains that Bronn did not fight with honor. Bronn agrees, but indicates that Vardis did fight with honor. Tyrion has proven his innocence in the eyes of [[Faith of the Seven|the gods]]. He retrieves his gold from Ser Rodrik and gives it to Mord. When Robin asks if he can make the little man fly now, Tyrion says, &quot;Not this little man.&quot; Bronn and Tyrion are allowed to depart.\n\nPrince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] comes to apologize to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] for the incident on the [[Kingsroad]]. He calls her his lady love and gives her a necklace. Sansa forgives him, and they seem reconciled. Sansa is unaware that the Queen put Joffrey up to the apology some time ago.\n\n[[File:Theon 1x06.jpg|thumb|Theon tells Ros he will miss her as she leaves for King's Landing.]]\n[[Ros]], the prostitute that Theon frequently sees, is departing Winterfell for King's Landing on the back of a turnip cart. Theon stops her and unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay. She explains that war is now imminent and the men (and thus her customer base) of Winterfell are destined to leave soon and probably never return; her departure is thus an economically essential decision. He throws her a coin to get her to raise her skirt one last time. As she rides off he says that he will miss her. She agrees that he will.\n[[Image:Eddard and the book.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eddard discovers the secret [[Jon Arryn]] died for.]]\nIn King's Landing, Eddard decides to send his daughters back to Winterfell. Arya is worried that she must leave Syrio. Sansa protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor, they are talking about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. Lord Eddard says that he will find someone else for her. Sansa refuses\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;she is going to marry Joffrey and have lots of golden-haired babies. This gives Eddard pause and sends him back to the [[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms|book]] that [[Jon Arryn]] was looking at before he died. Consulting the book's entry on [[House Baratheon]], Lord Eddard finds that every time a Baratheon has married, the children have had black hair... right up to Cersei and Robert's children, who are all blonde.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\n[[Image:Dany and the egg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and one of her [[dragon]] eggs.]]\nIn [[Vaes Dothrak]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is studying her [[dragon]] eggs. Despite [[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]]'s claim that they are now only stone, she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat, and places an egg on a brazier. Nothing happens, to her disappointment. She is removing the egg from the brazier, when [[Irri]] comes in and thinks she will scald herself. Irri takes the egg from her, but Daenerys is completely unharmed, and it is Irri who suffers scalding burns on her own hands.\n\n[[Image:Drogo carries Dany 1x6.jpg|thumb|Drogo lifts up Dany]]\n[[Image:Jorah and Viserys.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jorah Mormont]] prevents [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] from stealing Dany's eggs.]]\nDaenerys is summoned by the crones who rule the city, the ''[[dosh khaleen]]'', the wives of ''[[khal]]s ''slain in battle. She eats a stallion's heart and the crones read the omens. At first it seems Dany won't keep the raw meat down, but, to both her and Drogo's relief, she is able to compose herself. The crones declare Daenerys and [[Drogo]]'s son will be &quot;The Stallion That Mounts The World&quot;, a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in [[Dothraki]] history. Daenerys says his name will be [[Rhaego]], for her brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], slain by the usurper Robert Baratheon. Viserys is not impressed and rather disgusted by it all. He stands with Ser Jorah who explains the ritual to him. It is only when the Dothraki are chanting Rhaego's name, and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room, that Viserys realizes they love her. He storms out of the tent. Viserys is later discovered in Daenerys' tent by Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], trying to steal Dany's dragon eggs, but Jorah won't let him. Viserys tells Ser Jorah that to rule one must be feared or loved, and he has never been loved as the Dothraki love Dany. He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys, but he doesn't care. He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army, but he can't get past Ser Jorah and must leave the eggs. Mormont watches him as he leaves.\n\n[[Image:Viserys' crowning.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Khal [[Drogo]] gives Viserys a golden crown.]]\nDrunk, bitter and angry, Viserys interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo. He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to Drogo. Then he draws his sword, which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city, and threatens Dany and the unborn child, while Irri translates to Drogo. Drogo responds that he will give Viserys a golden crown &quot;that men will tremble to behold&quot;, and Viserys is pleased until Drogo's bloodrider [[Qotho]] breaks his arm, making him drop the sword, and kicks him to the floor. Drogo melts his golden belt in a pot, while Viserys begs Daenerys to help him. Ser Jorah tells her to look away, but she won't. She watches as Khal Drogo &quot;crowns&quot; Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head, causing Viserys to cry out in pure agony. As Daenerys watches her brother die, she coldly states that, having been killed by fire, Viserys was no true dragon.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Lord [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Mark Addy]] as King [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Emilia Clarke]] as Princess [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n* [[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as [[Petyr Baelish]]\n* [[Harry Lloyd]] as Prince [[Viserys Targaryen]]\n* [[Richard Madden]] as [[Robb Stark]]\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Maisie Williams]] as [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as [[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Jack Gleeson]] as Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n* and [[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n\n'''Also starring'''\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as Khal [[Drogo]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n\n'''Guest starring'''\n* [[Jerome Flynn]] as [[Bronn]]\n* [[Ron Donachie]] as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Lord Commander [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Finn Jones]] as Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] (credit only)\n* [[Kate Dickie]] as Lady [[Lysa Arryn]]\n* [[Julian Glover]] as Grand Maester [[Pycelle]]\n* [[Gethin Anthony]] as Lord [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Emun Elliott]] as [[Marillion]]\n* [[Miltos Yerolemou]] as [[Syrio Forel]]\n* [[Ciaran Bermingham]] as [[Mord]]\n* [[Susan Brown]] as Septa [[Mordane]]\n* [[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]]\n* [[Lino Facioli]] as Lord [[Robin Arryn]]\n* [[Esme Bianco]] as [[Ros]]\n* [[Amrita Acharia]] as [[Irri]]\n* [[Roxanne McKee]] as [[Doreah]]\n* [[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n* [[Brendan McCormack]] as Ser [[Vardis Egen]]\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as [[Rakharo]]\n* [[Dar Salim]] as [[Qotho]]\n* [[Eugene Simon]] as [[Lancel Lannister]]\n* [[Amira Ghazella]] as a [[Dothraki crone|Dothraki Crone]]\n* [[Niall Cusack]] as [[Joss]]\n* [[Stephen Don]] as [[Stiv]]\n* [[Patrick Rocks]] as a [[Knight of House Lynderly]]\n* [[Barrington Cullen]] as Lord [[Eon Hunter]]\n* [[Barry O'Connor]] as [[Wallen]]\n* [[David Michael Scott]] as Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast Notes===\n* Starring cast members [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] ([[Jaime Lannister]]), [[Kit Harington]] ([[Jon Snow]]) and [[Rory McCann]] ([[Sandor Clegane]]) are not credited and do not appear.\n* [[Jason Momoa]] (Khal [[Drogo]]) is credited as 'also starring' in the closing credits of the episodes.\n* [[Richard Madden]] is credited before [[Sophie Turner]] and [[Maisie Williams]], having being credited after them in the previous five episodes.\n* [[Natalia Tena]] is notably younger than her character, [[Osha]], is in the books.

The gummi-heart was injected with fake-blood which was basically a sugary syrup, so that it could burst out as she bit into the heart. By the end the actress was covered in the stuff which was like glue and everything stuck to her. When she used the bathroom she even glued herself to the toilet seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays DenOfGeek] and [http://winteriscoming.net/2012/12/emilia-clarke-on-jimmy-kimmel-live/ Emilia Clark on Jimmy Kimmel Live], December 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Viserys notes that Jorah Mormont is blocking him from leaving with the dragon eggs by saying &quot;Here you stand&quot;, and Jorah stares him down by replying and emphasizing &quot;Yet here I stand&quot;. In the books, the motto of House Mormont is actually stated to be &quot;Here We Stand&quot;. Its not clear if this was an intentional reference.\n* Originally the meaning of the phrase &quot;make the eight&quot; was unclear. However, it appears to be a reference to the fact that the Riverlands, having been under the occupation of the King of the Iron Islands at the time of Aegon's conquest, is not counted as one of the Seven Kingdoms in the TV series. In the novels, the term is considerably looser and more open to interpretation.\n*Set designer and art director, [[Gemma Jackson]] credits the inspiration for the Eyrie as being the Basilica Di San Clemente in Rome. The Weirwood Throne was actually three pieces of wood and was unpainted. And the [[Great Hall (Red Keep)|Great Hall of the Red Keep]] was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Blue-ray disc special feature &quot;Anatomy of an Episode&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The trial by combat scene had to be filmed across multiple takes, and during one actor [[Jerome Flynn]] (Bronn) accidentally slipped and fell on melted wax, which was left there from a previous take when he knocked over the candelabra. Once, he even fell into the prop opening for the Moon Door.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/game-of-thrones-bronn-jerome-flynn-comic-con.html Vulture.com], NYCC 2013 report.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Joffrey mentions the northern and southern-most castles of Westeros as being the Last Hearth in the north (the seat of [[House Umber]]) and [[Saltshore]] (in [[Dorne]]) in the south. This is not strictly accurate: the northern-most castles in the realm are the castles at [[the Wall]], most notably [[Castle Black]]. It is arguable that the southern-most castles are actually on the island known as [[the Arbor]], but the maps do not reveal at what end of the island the castles lie. It is possible that Joffrey omitted the castles of the Night's Watch on the Wall due to their extra-legal status, and also he was speaking of the &quot;lords and ladies&quot; who would come to a royal wedding, which the Night's Watch doesn't have.\n* There was a discussion of how Jack Gleason should play this scene. At first he was going to be disingenuous, but then it was decided that he was more weak than evil, as he is not utterly corrupted until he inherits the throne. He is sincerely apologizing as he did really want a girlfriend. The scene was filmed in an overly romantic way to make it seem melodramatic.&lt;ref&gt;Season 1 Blue-Ray disc special feature - Anatomy of an Episode&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Eddard mentions several members of [[House Baratheon]] detailed in the novels while reading the house's entry in Pycelle's book: [[Orys Baratheon]], the founder of the house; [[Lyonel Baratheon]], the Laughing Storm, a great knight featured in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s &quot;Dunk and Egg&quot; stories; and [[Steffon Baratheon]], the father of Robert, Renly and Stannis.\n*Viserys' death scene had to be performed in only one take, because it would ruin his costume after the first and only attempt. Smoke machines were strapped to his back and chest, a bald cap was made to resemble molten gold across his face, and the props department forged a gold-like substance that was poured over his head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays DenOfGeek]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* The death of Viserys makes Daenerys the rightful Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne, and her son after her.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nBranhostage.png|[[Bran Stark]] is held hostage by wildlings.\nBranandrobb.png|[[Robb Stark]] rescues his brother. \n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Memorable quotes": "'''[[Syrio Forel]]''': &quot;There is only one god.

Maisie cried on cue during the read-through of the scene where she has to drive Nymeria away, impressing Harry Lloyd.\n*Peter Dinklage said that the scene where Daenerys eats the horse's heart is his wife's favorite scene of the entire series.\n* Emilia Clarke has a fondness for [[wikipedia:Gummi bear|Gummi bears]] so was happy to hear that the horse's heart was made of a similar substance. Unfortunately, it tasted disgusting and the retching required no acting.\n* The scene between Viserys and Jorah was discussed between the two actors and David Benioff to get the right tone to the scene.\n* Peter Dinklage had no padding for the scenes where Mord beats him in the sky cell, so ended up with some bruises at the end of the day.\n* Some actors were given prosthetic scars while others had real scars that were highlighted with make-up.\n* The throne dais in the Eyrie had no safety rail, so actress Kate Dickie was directed to keep hold of Lino Facioli when he stood up as a safety precaution.\n* The Moon Door actually led to a pit filled with cardboard boxes.\n* Harry Lloyd likens the Vale to Wales, so finds the fact that Ser Vardis Egen has a Welsh accent very appropriate.\n* Peter Dinklage was a fan of Kate Dickie from some of her British film work and was looking forward to meeting her.\n* Originally the episode opened with Ser Gregor Clegane sacking a village in the Riverlands, but this was cut for time and budget reasons.\n* Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke only read the books once they have finished filming, so as to be surprised by the process as it goes along. Bryan Cogman also tracked down scenes from later books that gave more info about the characters and their motivations and recommended them to the actors.\n* Harry Lloyd looks at fan art online, and particularly enjoyed a fan map of [[Braavos]] that he found on the Internet.\n* Emilia Clarke was disappointed that the elaborate and lengthy climb to the Eyrie was not in the TV series.\n* Peter Dinklage noted the name similarity between Jack Gleeson and comedian [[wikipedia:Jackie Gleason|Jackie Gleason]] and found it amusing.\n* Peter Dinklage debated with his wife whether it was realistic for there to be only one prostitute in Winterfell. However, she pointed out in a small community there was only likely to be one, or at least one popular one.\n* The coin Ros catches from the back of the cart was CGI. (Harry Lloyd mishears the comment, however, and momentarily thinks they said Ros's &quot;flash&quot; was CGI).\n* According to Peter Dinklage, the CGI budget for Season 2 will be 'huge'.\n* Harry Lloyd studied a lot of 'drunk walking' videos on YouTube for his final scene.\n* The sword Harry Lloyd used in the final scene was very sharp and had to be handled carefully.\n* Drogo's gold belt melted far too quickly. Lloyd deadpans this is because it is 'Dothraki hybrid gold' that melts much more quickly than normal and then solidifies again.\n* The final shot of Daenerys required multiple takes as it was tricky to keep the camera in focus as it zoomed in close on her face.\n* The raw horse's heart Daenerys has to eat was actually a gelatinous construct which the crew told actress Emilia Clarke would taste like gummy bears. However, the foodstuff was extremely unpleasant to eat, especially as the crew had to keep injecting it with moisture for it to keep its gelatinous look. Emilia Clarke did not have to fake her scenes of disgust in this scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.com/television/1264476/46_things_we_learned_from_the_game_of_thrones_blurays.html Den of Geek]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* For the scene where Viserys is 'crowned', the prop department attached smoke machines to Harry Lloyd's back and front and placed a bald cap over his head to make it look like his hair and skin was being burned.
