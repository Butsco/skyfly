Queen Alysanne, who had flown on her [[dragon]] Silverwing to visit the Wall, convinced the Night's Watch to replace the older castle. Deep Lake was paid for by Queen Alysanne and built by the men that her husband Jaehaerys I, sent north. To the east of Deep Lake sits Queensgate.\n\n"}, "title": "Deep Lake"}
