Maester [[Aemon]] advises [[Jon Snow]] about growing into a man of the [[Night's Watch]], how he must mature into it and make selfless decisions. He therefore repeats to him the same advice he gave his own brother [[Aegon V Targaryen|Aegon]] when he was crowned king:  &quot;Kill the boy, and let the man be born.&quot;\n\n"}, "title": "Kill the Boy"}
