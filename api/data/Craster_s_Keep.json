It is the abode of [[Craster]], a [[wildling]] who lives there with his daughter-wives. Craster permits the use of the keep as a refuge and resupply post by the [[Night's Watch]] in return for otherwise leaving him alone and the occasional bribe.

The hall itself is large enough to accommodate a few dozen people at any one time. Still, for Night's Watch rangers far out beyond the Wall, its preferable to have a roof over their heads.\n\nThe Keep sits atop a low hill which some of the black brothers jokingly wonder if its made of mud or Craster's feces.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\n[[Jeor Mormont]], having taken the Night's Watch beyond the Wall, encounter several villages surprisingly abandoned by wildlings. When they stop at Craster's Keep, they learn from Craster that the wildlings have grouped together and united under [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] [[Mance Rayder]].

After his return to [[Castle Black]], [[Jon Snow]] urges the Watch to attack Craster's and kill the mutineers before they reveal the Watch's weakness to [[Mance Rayder]]. [[Alliser Thorne]] and [[Janos Slynt]] agree, expecting Jon to be killed in the attempt. However, a number of the brothers volunteer to join Jon, and the [[Raid on Craster's Keep|raid]] is successful, though several of the volunteers are killed, among them [[Locke]], who was on a mission from [[Roose Bolton]] to find and kill [[Eddard Stark]]'s remaining sons.
