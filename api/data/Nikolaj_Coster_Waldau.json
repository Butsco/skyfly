But, I think the years spent in King\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Landing, in that horrible place, has made him a very cynical human being and meeting someone who is almost na\u0102\u017bve, but also, just as you said\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;earnest\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;is, even though he's not aware of it\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;and he\u00e2&euro;&trade;s not, [and if he did], he would never admit it\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;but it does touch something inside of him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wicnet.tumblr.com/post/48143112357/game-of-thrones-nikolaj-coster-waldau-on-the-hand Game Of Thrones: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau On The Hand Jaime Was Dealt], Access Hollywood interview, April 16th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNikolaj also said what first went through his mind when he found out that Jaime would lose his right hand (in Season 3's &quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;):\n\n:&quot;I thought that was like\u00e2&euro;&rdquo;just amazing. It\u00e2&euro;&trade;s such a horrible thing to happen\u00e2&euro;\u015a If he had to pick a limb to lose, this would be the last one, I\u00e2&euro;&trade;m sure. This is his sword hand, this is what defines him, this is the one thing that he is incredible at\u00e2&euro;\u015a I think he sees himself as a soldier and it\u00e2&euro;&tilde;s very important for him and his identity to be the very best. And it has nothing to do with him being a Lannister and the family money and all the wealth and all that. It\u00e2&euro;&trade;s all about his skill and suddenly that one thing is gone and that\u00e2&euro;&trade;s just so interesting. For me as an actor, I know this is huge because, before this, he has this wonderful, annoying arrogance and wit and fearlessness with people and it\u00e2&euro;&trade;s just interesting what will happen next. And of course, I know what will happen next, but I think that to have a guy who starts in this one extreme and you go to the other, you couldn\u00e2&euro;&trade;t ask for more as an actor, really.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wicnet.tumblr.com/post/48143112357/game-of-thrones-nikolaj-coster-waldau-on-the-hand Game Of Thrones: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau On The Hand Jaime Was Dealt], Access Hollywood interview, April 16th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Credits": "===Starring===\n{{Season one credits|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes||yes||yes|yes}}\n{{Season two credits|yes||||||yes|yes||yes}}\n{{Season three credits||yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|||yes}}\n{{Season four credits|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes||yes}}\n\n", "See also": "*{{Template:WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 0182666}}\n\n", "Biography": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is married and has two daughters.
