A Queen consort committing infidelity against the King is also considered treason.\n\nThe punishment for treason is death, usually by public execution. If expedient, a traitor may instead be pardoned in exchange of [[hostage]]s or by agreeing to take the black and join the [[Night's Watch]].\n\nLike [[oathbreaking]], the nature of treason is not an absolute one and is subject to political machinations. It can often depend on whether said treason is successful. While a defeated rebel will be condemned and executed as a traitor, a victorious one will be in power and will merely receive the epithet [[usurper]].\n\nIn the city of King's Landing, those accused of treason are confined to the [[Black Cells]].\n\n", "Major cases and accusations of treason": "*The lords [[Robert Baratheon]], [[Eddard Stark]], [[Jon Arryn]], [[Hoster Tully]] and, later, [[Tywin Lannister]], as well as their bannermen, households, and followers, commit treason against their King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] when they [[Robert's Rebellion|rebel]] against him. However, as they are victorious in their rebellion they are never judged as such. Robert Baratheon, however, becomes known as &quot;The Usurper&quot; by those who, secretly, remain loyal to [[House Targaryen]].\n*Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] betrayed Aerys II when he counseled the Mad King to open the gates of [[King's Landing]] to Tywin Lannister when the latter presented himself before the city gates offering protection against the rebellion. Pycelle was aware Tywin did not intend to defend the city.\n*Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] violated his [[Kingsguard]] oath and murdered his king, Aerys II, during the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. He was subsequently pardoned by King Robert.\n*[[Eddard Stark]], acting in his authority as [[Hand of the King]], decides to move against Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]] and prevent his coronation by taking him prisoner, having discovered that Joffrey is a [[Bastardy|bastard]] with no right to the throne. [[Petyr Baelish]] reminds him that such action will be considered treason only if they lose. Baelish and [[Janos Slynt]] then [[Massacre in the Red Keep|betray Lord Stark]], who is arrested and then executed for treason against Joffrey, accused of seeking to install himself on the [[Iron Throne]].\n* The rebellion of [[the North]] and [[the Riverlands]] to secede from the authority of the [[Iron Throne]] is regarded as treason by those who remain loyal to King Joffrey.\n*[[Theon Greyjoy]] betrays [[Robb Stark]] and joins his father, [[Balon Greyjoy]], in his conquest of the North.\n* Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] is executed for treason against [[King in the North]] [[Robb Stark]] for the murders of hostages [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister]].\n* Lords [[Walder Frey]] and [[Roose Bolton]] commit treason when they conspire with [[Tywin Lannister]] to [[Red Wedding|eliminate]] Robb Stark and his family.\n*[[Tyrion Lannister]] is put on [[Second Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial]] for the regicide of King [[Joffrey]].\n\n"}, "title": "Treason"}
