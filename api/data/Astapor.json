Astapor is home of the infamous [[Unsullied]], [[Eunuchs|eunuch]] slave-soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/astapor/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Astapor entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Astapor's sigil, like that of the other cities of Slaver's Bay, is that of the [[harpy]], the ancient symbol of the [[Ghiscari Empire]], of which Astapor was once part. Though culturally still identifying itself as Ghiscari, Astapor is an independent city-state and is not officially aligned with the resurgent nation of [[Ghiscar]] to the south.\n\nThe flag of Astapor bears the Ghiscari [[Harpies|harpy]] holding between its talon a chain with open manacles on both ends.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Astapor, like its sister-cities of [[Yunkai]] and [[Meereen]], is culturally and historically [[Ghiscar]]i in origin, until the defeat of the old Ghiscari Empire by [[Valyria]] thousands of years ago. Following the Doom of Valyria, Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen have reestablished their Ghiscari traditions, but have not joined the resurgent Ghiscari nation based at [[New Ghis]].\n\nAstapor is located at the mouth of the Worm River. It is ruled by the Good Masters, slave-owners and traders who have become immensely wealthy. They live on large, stepped pyramids similar to those in Meereen, but not as large. It is called &quot;the Red City&quot; for the red brick its buildings are made of. The city contains fighting pits and slave markets.\n\nSlaves who displease their masters are tortured and displayed in the Plaza of Punishment, which is the first place a new slave brought into the city sees.\n\nThe trade of slaves, is usually conducted in the Plaza of Pride, an open market where the slavers take their customers to view their purchases. In the center of the plaza stands a red brick fountain with the a hammered bronze version of the Astapori harpy standing in its center.\n\nOf the three slaver-cities, Astapor is bigger than Yunkai, but Meereen has a bigger population than Astapor and Yunkai put together. The population of Astapor is not as big as that of [[Qarth]] or [[Pentos]].\n\n", "Notable residents": "\n*[[Cleon]], a former butcher and now King of Astapor.\n* {[[Kraznys mo Nakloz]]}, one of the [[Good Masters]] of Astapor. Burned alive by the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Drogon]] during the [[Sack of Astapor]].\n** [[Missandei]], his slave and translator, a [[Naath]]i. Now a [[handmaiden]] to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n** [[Grey Worm]], of the [[Unsullied]]. Now a follower of [[Daenerys Targaryen]].\n*{[[Greizhen mo Ullhor]]}, another Good Master.

However, Daenerys refuses to leave without having first recovered her [[dragons]] from the [[House of the Undying]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nDaenerys is convinced to travel to Astapor to procure the services of the eunuch slave-army known as the Unsullied. In Astapor she is nearly assassinated by the use of a [[manticore]], but is saved by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], who pledges his service to her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDaenerys later visits the [[Walk of Punishment (Astapor)|Walk of Punishment]], where slaves who have committed transgressions are tortured and put on display as a warning to others. Daenerys attempts to comfort a slave who has been condemned to death with water. \u00c2\u00a0He instead begs her to be allowed to die.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter purchasing the entirety of Unsullied of Astapor, as well as the slave-boys still in training to become Unsullied, Daenerys double crosses the [[Good Masters]]. Under her command, the Unsullied put all slaver masters in the city to the sword, sparing only the children, and liberate the slaves, while [[Drogon]], [[Viserion]], and [[Rhaegal]] are also [[Sack of Astapor|unleashed]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\n\nSer [[Jorah Mormont]] reports that the [[Astapori ruling council|council]] she left behind to rule the city in place of the Good Masters has been overthrown by a butcher named [[Cleon]], who has installed himself as [[king]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Astapor"}
