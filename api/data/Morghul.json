Morghul was never ridden. Morghul died in the [[Storming of the Dragonpit]] when it was invaded by a half-crazed angry mob after a one-handed prophet called the Shepherd began to rant against all dragons everywhere. There is little doubt that Morghul killed scores of people before being slain.\n\nShackled by heavy chains Morghul, it is written, was slain by a huge man who rushed headlong into the dragon's flame with spear in hand, thrusting its point repeatedly even as dragonflame melted the steel plate that encased him and devoured his flesh within. Since his real name was not known, the man became known as the Burning Knight when the tale spread.\n\n", "Biography": "During the [[Dance of the Dragons]], an angry mob of [[smallfolk]] [[Storming of the Dragonpit|stormed]] the [[Dragonpit]] where [[House Targaryen]] stabled their [[Dragons|dragons]].
