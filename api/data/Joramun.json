He was a legendary [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]].\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Joramun is a legendary [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] who not only fought the Night's King, but also blew the Horn of Winter to wake [[giants]] from the earth. According to legend, the Horn is capable of bringing the [[Wall]] down.\n\nGiven that the Night's King was only the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he and Joramun lived relatively soon after the Wall was completed - which ''may'' imply that Joramun was the very first King-Beyond-the-Wall, though this has not been confirmed.\n\nWhen [[Jon Snow]] comes to [[parley]] with [[Mance Rayder]] (actually to kill him), Mance shows him a huge horn, claiming it is the legendary Horn of Winter. He tells Jon to deliver an ultimatum to [[Castle Black]]: unless the wildlings are allowed to pass the Wall within three days, he will blow the horn and destroy the Wall.\n\n", "Biography": "According to legend, Joramun gathered the [[Free Folk]] to battle the [[Night's King]], who had made the [[Night's Watch]] into his personal army. He joined forces with the [[Stark]] [[King in the North|King of Winter]] [[Brandon Stark (the Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]] and together they [[Fall of the Night's King|brought down]] the Night's King.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night's Watch (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Joramun"}
