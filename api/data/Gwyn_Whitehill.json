At some point in her youth, she fell in love with [[Asher Forrester]], when he was seventeen. However, bloodshed ensured between the two rival houses, and he was exiled across the [[Narrow Sea]] to [[Essos]], ending their relationship.\n===&quot;[[Iron From Ice]]&quot;===\nGwyn does not appear in Iron From Ice but her name can be first seen on the codex page.\u00c2\u00a0\n===&quot;[[The Lost Lords]]&quot;===\nGwyn appears in this episode if [[Ryon Forrester|Ryon]] is not brought back to [[Ironrath]] for his father's and brother's funeral. She comes to Ironrath by her own accord, and wishes to speak to [[Rodrik Forrester|Lord Rodrik]]. She lets him know that she is looking after Ryon at Highpoint, and that he is worried he is forgotten about.\n===&quot;[[The Sword in the Darkness]]&quot;===\nIn this episode, [[Duncan Tuttle|Duncan]] tells Rodrik that Gwyn would like to speak to him. They ride out into the Ironwood forest traveling down a deforested path to meet Gwyn. Gwyn finds Rodrik and pleads with him to put an end to the fighting with diplomacy and peace rather than bringing their houses to open war. She also tells Rodrik that the Whitehills know about the plan the Forrester small council decided upon and warns him that there is a traitor among his council. She then sneaks off into the forest before a group of Whitehill men find them.\n\n"}, "title": "Gwyn Whitehill"}
