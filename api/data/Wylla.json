She has been mentioned as being alive after Jon Snow's birth yet it is uncertain if she is still alive.\n\nThe novels make the mystery of Wylla truly being Jon Snow's mother more overt than in the TV series. Jon Snow is repeatedly noted for his striking physical resemblance to Ned at a young age, more so than any of Ned's trueborn sons.\n\nThroughout the course of the novels, many characters mention rumors or speculate on other women as well as Wylla whom they believe to be Jon Snow's mother although. As in the TV series, the only woman that Ned himself ever identifies as Jon Snow's mother is &quot;Wylla&quot; - only once, when King Robert asked, and Eddard isn't in a position to refuse his king an answer. Ned also tells King Robert that he does not want to discuss Wylla any further with him since his adultery was his dishonor towards himself and [[Catelyn Stark|his wife]].\n\n", "Biography": "===[[Season 1]]===\nOver\u00c2\u00a0a meal, [[Robert Baratheon]] and [[Eddard Stark]]\u00c2\u00a0recall the names of several women they knew when they were younger.

The same as the first and only time they discuss it, Ned refuses to tell Robert what she looked like.
