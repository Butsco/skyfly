About how one of your King Crows found something... cold in the woods, with bright blue eyes. How he brought her home through your Wall and declared himself 'Night's King'.|[[Ygritte]]|The Night's Watch (Histories &amp; Lore)}}\n\nThe '''Night's King''' is an unseen character in ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''. He is a legendary figure known both in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and among the [[Free Folk]] dwelling [[Beyond the Wall]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Night's King was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch during its earliest years, not long after the [[Long Night]] ended and [[the Wall]] was completed. He is considered a legendary, half-mythical figure, not far removed from [[Bran the Builder]]. If he really did exist, it was almost eight thousand years ago - considering that while the Night's King was the thirteenth Lord Commander, at the time of the [[War of the Five Kings]], [[Jeor Mormont]] is the 997th Lord Commander.\n\nHowever, the Night's King fell in love with a woman &quot;with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars&quot;; he loved her though &quot;her skin was cold as ice&quot;, and when he gave his seed to her he gave her his soul as well. He brought her to the Nightfort and bound the brothers of the Night's Watch to his will through sorcery. He declared himself &quot;Night's King&quot; and ruled over the Wall and [[the Gift]] as his own. The [[King in the North]] [[Brandon Stark (the Breaker)|Brandon the Braeker]] and [[Joramun]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], [[Fall of the Night's King|joined forces to defeat him]].\n\nAfter he was killed, it was discovered that he had been making human sacrifices to the Others - the White Walkers - and all records of him were destroyed, and uttering his name was forbidden, so it became lost to history. \u00c2\u00a0As a result, numerous alternate legends of his identity exist in the present day: \u00c2\u00a0he may have been a [[House Bolton|Bolton]], a [[Magnar]] of [[Skagos]], an [[House Umber|Umber]], a Flint, a Norrey, or a Woodfoot, though [[Old Nan]] claims to know a version of the tale where he was actually a Stark, brother to the King-in-the-North, named Bran.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Night's King, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the Wall should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of the Night's King also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not &quot;rule&quot; the Wall but who serve the realms of men.\n\n", "Biography": "[[File:NightsKingQueen.jpg|thumb|300px|The Night's King and the Night's Queen enslaved the black brothers and performed human sacfrifices.]]\nAccording to legend, the Night's King was originally a [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Night's Watch]] who found in the [[Haunted Forest]] a [[Night's Queen|cold woman]] with bright blue eyes, seemingly a female [[White Walkers|White Walker]]. He took her to the other side of [[the Wall]] and declared himself &quot;Night's King&quot;. For thirteen years the two ruled over the brothers of the Night's Watch, performing human sacrifices. The Free Folk rallied under the banner of a [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] and marched against the [[Nightfort]], which the Night's King had taken as his seat, [[Fall of the Night's King|defeating him]] with the aid of [[House Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night's Watch (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Night's King"}
