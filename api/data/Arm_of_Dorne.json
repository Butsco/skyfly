All that is left of the land bridge now is an archipelago called the [[Stepstones]], which is located in the [[Narrow Sea]] between the Broken Arm of Dorne and the [[Disputed Lands]].\n\nAround 12,000 years before the [[War of Conquest]], the First Men came to Westeros from Essos by crossing the Arm of Dorne. When the First Men and the children of the forest first went to war, the old songs say [[Greenseer|greenseers]] of the children used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering the Arm, in a futile attempt to end the invasion of the First Men. Although the shattering of the Arm was successful, it was too late, for the First Men in Westeros had already crossed and the [[Wars of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|wars]] went on until [[the Pact]].\n\n"}, "title": "Arm of Dorne"}
