This causes the innkeeper and the other people to leave the room.\n\nWhen [[Brienne]] encounters three of the Brave Companions (Timeon, Pyg and Shagwell), they tell her that [[Rorge]] killed the innkeeper after he told them about the bloody brawl in the inn.\n\nThis innkeeper's story is more similar to a story Arya hears Chiswyck, one of the Mountain's men, telling at [[Harrenhal]]. He recalls that after the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]] Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and his men gang raped Layna, the daughter of the keeper of an inn on the [[Goldroad]]. Chiswyck estimates her to have been eighteen at the time of the rape, but Rafford corrects him by stating that she was only thirteen. The men find this hilarious, which angers Arya and influences her to name Chiswyck as the first to be killed by [[Jaqen H'ghar]].\n\n", "TOP": "Innkeeper022743hfgg509ec3eedmy7j56yngfi5v5lslt1627202014-10-19T22:48:39ZGourgeist5433366/* Biography */{{Character\n|Image = Innkeeper.png\n|Season = [[Season 4|4]]\n|First = \n|Appearances = &quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;\n|Status = [[:Category:Status: Alive|Alive]]\n|Family = [[Innkeeper's daughter|Unnamed daughter]]\n|Actor = [[Martin Walsh]]|Title = Innkeeper}}{{Template:Dialogue a-b|Innkeeper|Please.
