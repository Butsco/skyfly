Seven hells, that was a glorious day!|Robert Baratheon|Complete Guide to Westeros}}\nThe '''Battle of Summerhall''' was one of the first battles of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. It was actually three battles in a single day, all three won by [[Robert Baratheon]], then [[Lord of Storm's End]]. Afterward, Robert marched on [[Ashford]] in [[the Reach]], where he would experience his only [[Battle of Ashford|defeat]], leaving his brother, [[Stannis Baratheon]], to hold [[Storm's End]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Robert's Rebellion (Complete Guide to Westeros)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Blackwater (episode)|Blackwater]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Battle of Summerhall was the second battle of the rebellion. It was actually three battles all fought on one day. Robert hit three independent armies of Targaryen-loyalist Stormlords before they could converge upon him. Lords [[House Grandison|Grandison]], Cafferen, and Fell planned to join their hosts at Summerhall and march on Storm's End, but Robert learned of their plans and struck first, attacking each army individually. Lord Fell died in the battle and Robert's forces captured his son, Silveraxe. Lords Grandison and Cafferen, both loyalist commanders, went over to Robert after the battle, as did Silveraxe.\n\nThere's no mention of Tarly elements in this battle. Robert first fights the Tarlys in the Battle of Ashford. Also, Robert had already slain Marq Grafton in the Battle of Gulltown.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\n[[File:Battle_of_Summerhall_Robert_Baratheon.jpg|300px|thumb]]\nKing [[Robert Baratheon]] recalls how he made his first kill during the battle, a boy of [[House Tarly]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Battle of Summerhall"}
