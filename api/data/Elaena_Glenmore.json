They played hide-and-seek in the grove, where Elaena would always hide behind the same tree so Rodrik would find her.\n=== &quot;[[The Lost Lords]]&quot; ===\nElaena Glenmore arrives at [[Ironrath]] after hearing Rodrik survived the [[Red Wedding]] to discuss their betrothal. While happy to see him, she soon reveals that her family is having second thoughts about the betrothal. Based on the player's choice of discourse, she either decides to go ahead with the betrothal, or call it off as it's too dangerous.\n\nIf [[Mira Forrester|Mira]] had forged a note to Elaena from [[Margaery Tyrell]], Elaena will feel like she's being coerced into marrying Roderik, but can be convinced by allowing her to make her own choice. Alternatively, if Mira did not forge the letter, Rodrik can offer half of the Forresters' ironwood to satisfy the Glenmores.\n\nAfter their discussion, [[Ludd Whitehill|Lord Ludd Whitehill]] rudely enters. He asks if Elaena is still marrying Rodrik, arguing that his son, [[Gryff Whitehill|Gryff]], still needs a wife. Depending on whether or not the betrothal was won, Elaena will either proudly affirm that she is marrying Rodrik, or say that she has not yet reached a decision. After Ludd demands Rodrik kiss his ring, Elaena will either (depending on player choice) express relief that Rodrik didn't show weakness, or disappointment for him showing weakness.\n\n"}, "title": "Elaena Glenmore"}
