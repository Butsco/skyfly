Many of Varys' &quot;little birds&quot; are seemingly innocuous street children.\n\nVarys' network spans not only the length and breadth of Westeros, but also [[Essos]] as far east as [[Vaes Dothrak]] and possibly even [[Qarth]].\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, at least some of Varys' &quot;little birds&quot; have had their tongues cut out (though Varys himself did not cut them out).\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 1]]===\nVarys informs [[Catelyn Stark]] that he has &quot;little birds&quot; all over the continent, even in [[the North]]. He is already aware of the [[Valyrian steel]] dagger that was used in the attempt on [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s life, and knew that Catelyn and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] were coming.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhile walking in the [[Red Keep]]'s gardens, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] identifies several of Varys' &quot;little birds&quot; to [[Eddard Stark]], most notably several children.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Little Bird|A young boy]] reaches Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] at the market at [[Vaes Dothrak]], gives him a letter of pardon from King [[Robert Baratheon]] for his reports on the movements of [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]], and informs him he can go home. The letter clues Ser Jorah that an assassination attempt against Daenerys is imminent.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nShortly before the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] Varys' little birds bring him tidings from the edge of [[the Known World]]: Daenerys Targaryen still lives, and has hatched three [[dragons]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nVarys, aware that Petyr Baelish has mistreated [[Ros]] since she came into his service, offers Ros a chance to work for him as a spy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nRos continues to act as one of Varys' little birds, informing him of Littlefinger's plan of taking [[Sansa Stark]] with him to [[the Eyrie]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Ros' arrangement is eventually discovered by Littlefinger, who then sells Ros to Joffrey for target practice before Varys can protect her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Climb]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nIn a meeting of the\u00c2\u00a0[[Small Council]], Varys informs\u00c2\u00a0Tywin\u00c2\u00a0that Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0has come to power in [[Meereen]] and is growing stronger, with three [[dragon]]s, two experienced knights at her side, and a powerful army behind her.\u00c2\u00a0Tywin decides to deal with her.
