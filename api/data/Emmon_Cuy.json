One of the guards tries to burn her using a flaming torch, but her cloak is too soaked with blood to burn. Brienne cuts the guard's hand, fights Cuy and the remaining guard, and apparently kills the latter.

Ser Emmon and Ser Robar are later killed by Lord Commander Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] in a fit of rage, because of their failure to protect King Renly and their allowing Brienne to escape.
