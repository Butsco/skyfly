Writer's assistant [[Dave Hill]] (who wrote the &quot;[[Histories &amp; Lore]]&quot; animated featurettes on the Blu rays for Seasons 2, 3, and 4) then suggested to Benioff and Weiss that Olly should then join the Night's Watch, because he has nowhere else to go. Hill also suggested that it would make dramatic sense if they make Olly the one who kills Ygritte during the Battle of Castle Black (in the books, it wasn't clear who fired the arrow that killed her). Benioff and Weiss were so impressed with this suggestion that they promoted Hill, and he will be writing an episode script in [[Season 5]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://variety.com/gallery/photos-showrunners-impact-report/#!13/david-benioff-d-b-weiss/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;In the books==\n\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;In\u00c2\u00a0the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character by this name. However, Jon takes another young black brother, Satin, under his wing.\n\nIn the novels, it wasn't clear who shot the arrow that mortally wounded Ygritte. When Jon Snow found her, for a frantic moment he feared that he was the one who shot her - but when he checked the arrow in her he recognized that the fletching on it was different from the arrows he was using. Ygritte dies in Jon Snow's arms, with essentially the same dialogue as in the TV series. Afterwards, Jon decides that he'd rather not know which of his sworn brothers fired the arrow that killed Ygritte, so he makes no attempt to check.\n\nThree quarters of the inhabitants of [[Mole's Town]] flee to Castle Black after Jon Snow warns them of the wildling raiding parties. The blacksmith Donal Noye, who takes command in the absence of other officers, allows them to stay on condition that they take part in the defense of the castle during the battle. Olly in the TV series, however, is not from Mole's Town but a smaller village in its vicinity (Jon explained that the wildlings were progressively attacking bigger settlements to try to draw out Castle Black's garrison, working their way up to Mole's Town). It is unknown if any people from other villages come to seek refuge at the castle. After the attack of the Thenns is repelled, many of the villagers think that the worst is behind and return to the village. A few residents from Mole's Town decide to stay rather than risk going back to the weakly defended lands to the south, among them: Zei the whore, Hareth (aka Horse) the stablehand and three young orphans (nine, eight and five years old) whose father was killed on the steps. Olly is perhaps loosely based on those orphans, though it is not mentioned whether they take active part in the battle and what becomes of them later. Zei is sent by Jon to the village to recruit the villagers, but she does not return. After the battle is over, Hareth joins the Watch.\n\nIn the TV series, the only survivors of the [[Sack of Mole's Town]] appear to be [[Gilly]] and her baby, as they are the only ones from Mole's Town who arrive at Castle Black.\n\n", "TOP": "Olly023437nsrzy23mj904nm44wdb7jvc4iejrumf1800912015-03-28T21:02:06ZArticXiongmao15030876/* Season 4 */{{Heraldry\n|image=Crow mini shield.png\n|link=Night's Watch\n}}\n{{Character\n|Title = Olly\n|Image = Olly.jpg\n|Season = [[Season 4|4]], [[Season 5|5]]\n|First = &quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;\n|Appearances = 5 episodes &lt;small&gt;[[#Appearances|(see below)]]&lt;/small&gt;\n|Status = [[:Category:Status: Alive|Alive]]\n|Aka= \n| Allegiance=The [[Night's Watch]]\n|Culture = [[Northmen]]\n|Family = {[[Guymon]]} - Father &lt;br&gt;{[[Olly's mother|Unnamed mother]]}\n|Place=Unnamed village, [[the Gift]]\n|Actor = [[Brenock O'Connor]]}}\n{{Quote|Get me to the top.
