House Reed is\u00c2\u00a0the southern-most house of [[the North]]. They control the vast area of swampland and bog stretching across the narrowest part of the continent of [[Westeros]], [[the Neck]]. The Reeds and their vassals are [[Crannogmen]], a distinct off-shoot of the [[First Men]] who have adapted to living in the swamps of the Neck.\n\nHouse Reed's [[heraldry]] is a black [[Lizard-lions|lizard-lion]] on a grey-green field. \u00c2\u00a0\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Reed family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the crannogmen of the Neck are gifted and talented hunters and warriors. They have an ages-old feud with [[House Frey]], who rule the lands immediately to the south. The Reeds came to the attention of their liege lords, House Stark, when Howland Reed met [[Eddard Stark]] at a [[tournament]] at [[Harrenhal]]. Howland Reed and Eddard Stark became fast friends and allies. Aside from Eddard, Howland was the only survivor of the raid at the Tower of Joy, on the occasion of [[Lyanna Stark]]'s death. The Reed stronghold at Greywater Watch is hard to find because it supposedly moves around on a floating island.\n\n===Vassals===\n* House Fenn\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;e\n* [[House Marsh]]\n* House Peat\n* House Boggs\n* House Cray\n* House Quagg\n* House Greengood\n* House Blackmyre\n\n", "Members": "* Lord [[Howland Reed]], Lord of Greywater Watch and the head of the family.\n** [[Meera Reed]], Lord Howland's daughter and heir.\n** {[[Jojen Reed]]}, Lord Howland's son and former heir.
