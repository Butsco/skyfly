He thus only controlled six of the seven kingdoms plus [[the Riverlands]], which historically has never been counted as one of the &quot;seven&quot;. Dorne only joined the Targaryen realm through peaceful marriage-alliance fully two centuries after the [[War of Conquest]] (about one century before the [[War of the Five Kings]]).\n\nWhen Aegon I began his conquest of Westeros, he unilaterally declared himself king and lord of all of the Seven Kingdoms, before proceeding to actually conquer kingdoms such as [[the Reach]] or [[the Westerlands]]. Aegon's armies were repulsed from Dorne due to guerrilla warfare - but he never stopped claiming the title. Subsequent Targaryen kings continued to use the title &quot;Lord of the Seven Kingdoms&quot; as a tacit declaration that they still laid claim to Dorne and intended to conquer it eventually. A century and a half later, King [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron I]] even managed to briefly conquer Dorne, but the occupation was thrown off and it remained independent for another half century.\n\n"}, "title": "Lord of the Seven Kingdoms"}
