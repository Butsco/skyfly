Catelyn thought her sister was still in the capital.\n\nCatelyn reads the letter and immediately burns it. She tells Eddard that, according to Lysa, the Lannisters are plotting against King Robert. They arranged Jon Arryn\u00e2&euro;&trade;s death and the king\u00e2&euro;&trade;s life is in danger. Lysa has fled to the Vale with her son to prevent any action being taken against them. Luwin gives them his counsel: Robert trusts Eddard more than any other man. If there is a plot against the king, Eddard is the best man to smoke it out in the capital. Catelyn angrily replies that Eddard has spent half his life fighting wars for Robert and has served him more than ably enough. She also points out that Eddard's [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark (Son of Rickard)|brother]] once rode south and never came back, but Luwin points out that that was a different time and a different king.\n\n", "Scene 30": "[[File:Winter_is_Coming_Sansa_food_Arya.png|thumb|Arya flings food at Sansa]]\nArya flings some food at Sansa, to Robb\u00e2&euro;&trade;s hilarity.

There is feasting and dancing. Viserys asks when they can start planning the invasion of Westeros, but Illyrio replies that the Dothraki do things in their own time, and will only make war when their omens favor it. Viserys is unimpressed by their omens.\n\nTwo Dothraki get into an altercation over a girl; the two men pummel each other first with fists, then swords are drawn\u00c2\u00a0and one kills the other. Illyrio tells Viserys that a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.\n\nDaenerys and Drogo are given many gifts. Drogo is pleased to see &quot;Jorah the Andal&quot;, a noted warrior from Daenerys\u00e2&euro;&trade;s own country. He introduces himself as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] of [[Bear Island]]. He gifts Daenerys with books of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms. He says he is loyal to the true king of Westeros and hopes to always serve him. Viserys accepts his offer.\n\nIllyrio then presents his gift: three spherical, stone objects. He tells Daenerys that they are reportedly dragon eggs, from the [[Shadow Lands]] beyond [[Asshai]]. The centuries have turned them to stone, but they are still beautiful. Daenerys is impressed by the gift.\n\nDrogo declares the feasting done and gives Daenerys his own gift to her: a beautiful white horse. She asks Jorah how to say, &quot;Thank you,&quot; in [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]], but he replies that there is no such phrase in their language.

Sandor is bemused that he would even try hunting, but Tyrion boasts he is the greatest hunter in the land and his spear never misses. Sandor points out it\u00e2&euro;&trade;s not hunting if you have to pay for it.\n\nRobert asks Eddard if he is still as good a huntsman as he used to be. Eddard replies no, but he\u00e2&euro;&trade;s still better than Robert. Robert thanks him for accepting his offer, as he knows it was not an easy choice to make.

He never had to teach Eddard much, but he set Robert to rights. Robert regrets he didn\u00e2&euro;&trade;t always listen to him.\n\nRobert asks Eddard to serve him as Hand of the King. Eddard says he is not worthy of the honor, but Robert tells him it isn\u00e2&euro;&trade;t an honor. He wants Eddard to run his kingdom for him while he eats, drinks and whores his way to an early grave. Robert tells Eddard that he helped him win the [[Iron Throne]] and now he can help him keep it.

Robb notes a smile exchanged between Prince Joffrey and Sansa. Arya starts identifying members of the royal party, but Sansa tells her to shut up. Eddard watches in slight bemusement as King Robert, who is a portly man, requires help to dismount his horse. He greets Eddard by telling him he\u00e2&euro;&trade;s gotten fat. When Eddard raises a questioning eyebrow at the king\u00e2&euro;&trade;s own girth, they both burst into laughter. Robert greets Catelyn and the children warmly, telling Sansa she is a beauty and Bran that he will be a soldier. Queen Cersei also greets the Starks, though more reservedly. Robert asks Eddard to take him to the crypts so he can pay his respects. Cersei objects, pointing out they have been on the road for a month, but Robert ignores her.\n\nAs Robert and Eddard leave, Arya ponders where \u00e2&euro;&tilde;the Imp\u00e2&euro;&trade; is.

Benjen, concerned about Jon, offers him a place amongst the sworn brothers of the Night\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Watch. Jon considers only for a moment before accepting. Surprised at the speed of his response, Benjen points out that there are drawbacks to being a member of the Watch, such as not being able to take a wife or have children. Jon says he does not care about that, but Benjen points out he might, one day. Benjen goes into the feast, suggesting they\u00e2&euro;&trade;ll talk about this again later.\n\nTyrion Lannister arrives at the courtyard, catching the end of the conversation. He introduces himself to Jon and muses that he\u00e2&euro;&trade;s always wanted to see the Wall. He states that Jon is &quot;the [[bastard]]&quot;, to Jon\u00e2&euro;&trade;s annoyance. Noting this, Tyrion advises him to take the name and wrap himself in it, using it as armor so it can never hurt him. The rest of the world will never forget what he is, so why should he?

Benjen says the two he was with are still missing beyond the Wall. Eddard points out it could have been a wildling ambush and Benjen says it could.

Sansa asks how long they will have to wait to be married, but Catelyn tells her that her father has not even decided to accept the king\u00e2&euro;&trade;s offer. Sansa is puzzled as to why he would refuse: the King\u00e2&euro;&trade;s Hand is the second-most-powerful position in the Seven Kingdoms. Catelyn tells her that Sansa would have to leave Winterfell and leave her parents behind, but Sansa points out that Catelyn had to leave [[Riverrun|her home]] and family to come to Winterfell.

He tells him that the people want the return of their rightful king, and drink secret toasts to Viserys's health. Viserys asks when the marriage will take place and Illyrio replies very soon, as the Dothraki do not like to stay in one place for very long.\n\nViserys asks if it is true that the Dothraki lie with their horses. Illyrio advises against asking Khal Drogo this. Viserys angrily asks if he thinks he is a fool, but Illyrio smoothly says that Viserys is a king, and kings sometimes lack the caution of common men. Viserys is aware of the deal: he will give Drogo a queen, and he will give him an army.\n\nDaenerys speaks up, saying that she does not want to be Drogo\u00e2&euro;&trade;s queen. She just wants to go home. Viserys agrees, but points out that their home has been taken from them.

While waiting for her bath, Daenerys is visited by her brother. Illyrio has sent gifts for the wedding feast. Daenerys is puzzled as to why Illyrio has hosted them in his home for more than a year and lavished them with gifts. Viserys replies that it is because Illyrio is not a fool, and he knows that Viserys will richly reward him once he takes back his kingdom. He has Daenerys undressed and advises her to show off her woman\u00e2&euro;&trade;s body. He needs her to be perfect today, lest she &quot;wake the [[dragon]]&quot;. Departing, Viserys says that when they write the history of his reign, they will say it began on this day.\n\nDaenerys, unmoved by her brother's arrogance, gets into her bath.

Irritated, Eddard says he does not fight in [[Tournament|tournaments]]. Jaime tries to bait him, asking if he is too old for it.

Eddard agrees they should be killed and Theon reaches for the first one. Jon stops him by pointing out that there are five pups, one for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the symbol of House Stark, so the children were meant to have them. Eddard reflects on this for a moment and then agrees. However, the children must care for them themselves, even burying them if they die. Bran asks Jon why he did not include himself in the count, and he replies that he is not a Stark. However, just as they are leaving he finds a sixth pup, [[Ghost|an albino]], cowering behind a tree.

Eddard beheads Will using his [[Valyrian steel]] greatsword, [[Ice]].\u00c2\u00a0Bran does not flinch.

Ser Waymar points out that the [[Jeor Mormont|Lord Commander]] will ask what killed the wildlings and they need to investigate further. Will points out that they could meet the same fate, but Ser Waymar dismisses his concerns. He states that if Will were to flee south, he\u00e2&euro;&trade;d be beheaded as a deserter.\n[[File:Will.jpg|thumb|Will is terrified after seeing a Wight of a wildling girl]]\nReturning to the spot of the massacre, they find no sign of the wildlings, only a few spots of blood. Ser Waymar and Gared investigate the site while Will scouts the surrounding area. Gared finds a bloody bit of clothing on the floor. Ser Waymar asks what it is, but before he can answer a [[White Walkers|tall, shadowy figure with glowing blue eyes]] rises from the snow behind him and speaks with a [[Skroth|voice like cracking ice]]. Gared, stunned in terrified silence, can only attempt to mouth a warning, pointing at the danger behind his fellow ranger;\u00c2\u00a0Ser Waymar turns to see what is the matter and is swiftly\u00c2\u00a0killed by the creature as it swings a sword at him.\n\nWill hears Gared\u00e2&euro;&trade;s cries, but before he can respond he sees the dead wildling girl from earlier. She is now standing by herself and turns to look at Will with blue eyes similar to those of the creatures. Will flees. He encounters Gared and is just in time to see him being beheaded by another of the creatures. The creature throws the head to land at Will\u00e2&euro;&trade;s feet. Will looks up to meet his fate.\n\n"}, "title": "Winter is Coming recap"}
