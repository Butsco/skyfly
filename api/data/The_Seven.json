{"attributes": {}, "sections": {" Aspects ": "\nEach of the Seven aspects symbolizes a different part of life and are prayed to for different purposes. They are known as the Father, the Mother, the Maiden, the Crone, the Warrior, the Smith, and the Stranger.\n\n===The Father===\n\n[[The Father]] represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead.\n\n===The Mother===\n\n[[The Mother]] represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as &quot;the strength of women&quot;.\n\nThe hymn ''[[Gentle Mother, Font of Mercy]]'' is dedicated to Her praise.\n\n===The Maiden===\n\n[[The Maiden]] represents purity, love, and beauty.  She protects the chastity of virgins.\n\n===The Crone===\n[[The Crone]] represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern.\n\n===The Warrior===\n[[The Warrior]] represents strength and courage in battle.\n\n===The Smith===\n[[The Smith]] represents creation and craftsmanship.\n\n===The Stranger===\n\n[[The Stranger]] represents death and the unknown. It is rarely prayed to.\n\nThe Stranger is served by an all-female monastic order, the [[Silent Sisters]], who are tasked with preparing the bodies of the dead for funerals. For this reason they are also known as the &quot;Wives of the Stranger&quot;.\n\nThe Stranger is depicted as neither male nor female, thus the number of male and female aspects within the godhead is equal: three males (Father, Warrior, Smith), three females (Maiden, Mother, Crone), and one who is neither.\n\nUnlike the other aspects which are represented as human figures in artwork, because the Stranger represents the unknown it is often portrayed in a wide variety of forms, often frightening. Sometimes it is represented as a skeletal figure, or a non-human creature possessing various animalistic features.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|The Seven is a single deity with seven aspects, each representing a different area of life.

For this reason, the deity is often referred to as the &quot;Seven-faced God&quot;. In practice, many devotees will refer to the aspects as &quot;Gods&quot; plural, though priests of the Faith will attempt to stress the theological nuance to their followers that there is indeed only one God, the &quot;Seven-in-One&quot; deity. This has not stopped the commonly heard exclamation &quot;Gods be good!&quot; from being used pervasively throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The Seven are referred to as &quot;the New Gods&quot; or &quot;New God&quot; to distinguish them from the [[Old Gods of the Forest]] worshiped by the [[First Men]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Complete Guide to Westeros]]: &quot;The Old Gods and the New&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAccording to tradition, the Seven manifested themselves to the [[Andals]], the inhabitants of the [[Hills of Andalos]] in the continent of [[Essos]], six thousand years before the [[War of the Five Kings]].
