She was regarded as the most beautiful woman in [[Westeros]].\n\nWhen Aegon made his intentions known to the Kings of Westeros, Queen Sharra, who was ten years older than Aegon, sent him a portrait of her and a marriage proposal with the condition she made her son his heir. Aegon refused, prompting the Vale to resist the invasion. At the Battle of Gulltown, Visenya Targaryen was defeated, but she managed to burn the Arryn fleet. Rather than join the alliance of the [[Kingdom of the Reach]] and the [[Kingdom of the Rock]], Sharra adopted a siege strategy, closing the [[Bloody Gate]] and positioning her land armies to massacre the Targaryen army if it tried to force the mountain pass. The result was that the strength of the Vale was not present at the [[Field of Fire]].\n\nNevertheless, by the time Sharra returned to the Eyrie she found Visenya already there, with King Ronnel sitting on her lap, asking his mother if he could take a ride on Vhagar. The implicit threat of her son being held by Visenya was enough to make Sharra surrender.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\n[[Image:Visenya takes the Eyrie.jpg|thumb|Visenya Targaryen flew hew dragon directly over the mountains to the Eyrie.]]\nQueen Sharra was alongside her son when [[Visenya Targaryen]] flew to [[the Eyrie]] demanding submission, Ronnel bent the knee to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and surrendered the [[Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]] in exchange for a ride atop [[Vhagar]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Vale (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Sharra Arryn"}
