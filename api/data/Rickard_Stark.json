He is deceased when the events of the series begin. He is not expected to appear in the series. Rickard Stark was the [[Lord of Winterfell]] and head of [[House Stark]]. He was killed by the Mad King, [[Aerys II Targaryen]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Rickard's role is unchanged.\n\nIn ''A Clash of Kings'', Jaime Lannister explains to Catelyn Stark just how he died: Rickard demanded trial by combat to clear his son's name, assuming he would face a Kingsguard such as Jaime, but the Mad King had him locked in a cage with fire spewing beneath it, saying &quot;''Fire'' is the champion of House Targaryen&quot; when Brandon tried to stop his father's death, he ended up strangling himself due to the device the Targaryen men had strapped him to. Jaime did not say how many knights were present, only that Gerold Hightower was there, and told him that they were sworn to defend the king, not to judge him.\n\nRickard's father was Lord Edwyle Stark. Edwyle's sister (Rickard's aunt) married a junior member of [[House Royce]] from [[The Vale of Arryn|the Vale]], and through her the Royces are blood relatives of the Starks. The Royce whom Rickard's aunt married was a member of the cadet branch of the main line of that family known as House Royce of the Gates of the Moon (or perhaps, he was specifically the founder of that cadet branch). Thus Nestor Royce, the head of House Royce of the Gates of the Moon at the time of the War of the Five Kings, is Eddard Stark's second cousin. After hearing of the [[Sack of Winterfell]] and the alleged deaths of his brothers, Eddard's son [[Robb Stark]] felt the need to name a new heir (otherwise the Lannisters would press a claim to Winterfell through Sansa's forced marriage to Tyrion). Eddard's widow Catelyn Tully suggested naming one of the Royces due to this distant blood relationship - either way the point was rendered moot after the deaths of them both and the destruction of the Northern army at the [[Red Wedding]].\n\n", "Quotes": "{{dialogue a-b|Eddard Stark|My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen.

Aerys II imprisoned Brandon and ordered that Rickard ride south to answer for his son's impertinence. Against advice, Rickard agreed, assuming that the matter would be settled through a trial or a bargain of some kind. Instead, Aerys had Lord Rickard burned alive while Brandon watched, and then had Brandon strangled.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe kidnap of Lyanna and the cold-blooded murder of Rickard and Brandon Stark in front of the entire Royal Court made the new Lord of Winterfell, Eddard Stark, declare war against the [[Targaryen]] family, supported by Lyanna's betrothed, [[Robert Baratheon]], and the powerful lords [[Hoster Tully]] and [[Jon Arryn]].
