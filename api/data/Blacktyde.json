{"attributes": {}, "sections": {" In the books ": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Blacktyde does not have a very distinguished history. However, at the beginning of the narrative its current lord is Baelor Blacktyde, who spent eight years as a [[ward]] on the mainland after the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], much as [[Theon Greyjoy]] was sent as a hostage to [[Winterfell]]. Unlike Theon, Baelor Blacktyde spent his years as a ward in [[Oldtown]] in [[the Reach]], one of the major centers of [[Andal]] culture. When Baelor returned (when he came of age, seven years ago), he was an ardent convert to the [[Faith of the Seven]]. Due to Baelor Blacktyde's household, Blacktyde is the only one of the Iron Islands with any minority to speak of who follow the Faith of the Seven instead of the [[Drowned God]].\n\n", "TOP": "Blacktyde0134101e4zheot8xlsu4zlxr763wnic0xq6i21206072014-03-28T21:31:01ZGreater good3347453/* See also */'''Blacktyde''' is one of the seven main [[Iron Islands]], an archipelago located on [[Ironman's Bay]], on the western side of [[Westeros]].\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n"}, "title": "Blacktyde"}
