He is played by guest star [[Miltos Yerolemou]] and debuts in &quot;[[Lord Snow]].&quot; Syrio Forel is a master sword-fighter and instructor hired by [[Eddard Stark]] to train [[Arya Stark]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Syrio Forel was once the First Sword of Braavos, the most skilled bravo or sword-fighter of the city, in the service of the Sealord himself. He specialized in a style of combat known as 'water dancing', favoring a light sword and expert balance over the Westerosi style of hacking at one another with massive swords in heavy armor. It is unclear why he departed Braavos to relocate to King's Landing.\n\nSyrio tells Arya how he became the first sword of Braavos. He was chosen over stronger, faster, and younger men because he was perceptive - he saw while others were blind. He was invited to an audience with the ruler of Braavos, who had a cat on his lap. The ruler said to Syrio, as he had said to all the others that had failed this test, to look at the fantastic animal that has been brought to him from far away, was she not astonishing. Syrio replied &quot;I see many like him every night in the streets of Braavos, it is a tomcat.&quot; The ruler pressed him with questions on the ears and the belly but Syrio maintained his answer. Others answered with flattery and unfounded claims about the virtues of the animal. Syrio was chosen over all of them. The lesson to look carefully and see what is truly there is taken to heart by Arya.\n\nEddard is bemused by Syrio's odd training methods, which see Arya balancing on one foot for hours and chasing cats around the Red Keep, and is not impressed when she returns from her classes covered in cuts and bruises. He suggests hiring another swordsman to instruct her, such as [[Barristan Selmy]] or [[Jory Cassel]], but Arya insists that she only wishes to be trained by Syrio.\n\nHis appearance differs from his TV series's counterpart, described in the book as a slight, bald man with a beaked nose. In the DVD commentary, author [[George R.R. Martin]] himself said that he didn't care about such minor differences, being more concerned with the satisfying performance of the actor.\n\nBraavos is the most diverse of the Free Cities, being founded by escaped slaves of the [[Valyrian Freehold]] who originally came from all the far corners of that empire. As a result, there is no set Braavosi &quot;ethnicity&quot; or set of typical physical features, in contrast to how people from the Free City of [[Lys]] tend to be blonde and fair-skinned and the people of [[Myr]] tend to have dark hair and olive-colored skin. As the most powerful of the Free Cities and a major economic hub, it is also much more diverse and &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; even compared to the other Free Cities. The [[Common Tongue]] of Westeros is not Syrio's first language, and Arya describes him as having an accent, a &quot;lilt&quot;, but the books don't describe it in detail.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nSyrio's battle with Ser [[Meryn Trant]] and the Lannister guards in the TV series is portrayed much as it was in the books: except that Syrio kills or maims most of his opponents with his wooden sword. He kills one with a blow through the eye and breaks another's kneecap. As Arya watches Syrio fight, she realizes that he had merely been toying with her during her training sessions. He continues to fight Trant even after his wooden sword is broken, and as Arya runs away she hears his battle cry. In both the series and the book, his fate is left uncertain.\n\nWhen Arya first sees [[Jaqen H'ghar]], he somewhat reminds her of Syrio, and to her surprise, he knows her real identity. This has led to fan speculation that Jaqen and Syrio are the same person, but so far this has not been verified.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Syrio Forel&quot; is pronounced &quot;SEER-ee-o For-EL&quot;.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|- Do you pray to the gods?&lt;br&gt; - [[The Old Gods of the Forest|The Old]] and [[The Faith of the Seven|the New]].&lt;br&gt; - There is only one god, and His name is Death.

He hires Syrio Forel to train Arya in its use. Forel accepts the commission and begins to train Arya in how to use the sword in the Braavosi style, known as the [[Water Dance]]. Arya's lessons are kept a secret; her sister [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] believes that Arya is getting &quot;dancing lessons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEddard finds Arya balancing on the top of some stairs.

He teaches her how to forget her troubles so she can concentrate on fighting.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After Eddard's arrest for treason, [[Lannister]] guards led by Ser [[Meryn Trant]] of the [[Kingsguard]] arrive to take Arya into custody. Syrio informs them that he will protect her. When they try to barge past him, he disarms one guard with a training sword. He fights off a mass attack by the guardsmen and then engages Ser Meryn, telling Arya to run. When she asks him to come with her, he tells her, &quot;The First Sword of Braavos does not run.&quot; Arya flees, and (unseen) Syrio and Ser Meryn continue their fight.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nArya believes Syrio to be dead, and tells [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] that he was killed by Ser Meryn Trant.
