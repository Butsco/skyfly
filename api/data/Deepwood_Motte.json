The castle is located north-west of [[Winterfell]] in the [[Wolfswood]], near the coast of the [[Bay of Ice]].\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Deepwood Motte is a motte-and-bailey wooden castle rather than a more formidable stone construction. In past centuries, the castle and the surrounding area were prey to long-ranging raids by the [[ironborn]], but it has been some considerable time since this was the case. The castle is not located on the coast due to the muddy tidal flats along the coast. Instead it is built on a hill which commands the surrounding area.\n\nDeepwood Motte is located approximately three hundred miles from Winterfell.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\nHaving declared himself [[King of the Iron Islands|King]], [[Balon Greyjoy]] sends his daughter [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] with a fleet of thirty ships with orders to seize Deepwood Motte. Yara replies that she always wanted a castle of her own.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater, Yara visits Winterfell, having successfully [[Battle of Deepwood Motte|captured]] the castle of Deepwood Motte. She points out to [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] that her castle lies close to the sea and can be easily taken and reinforced at will, while Winterfell is too far inland to be held indefinitely. She urges him to abandon the castle and return to Deepwood Motte with her before heading home, but he rejects her advice.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Deepwood Motte"}
