Ygritte convinces him to spare Jon because of his Stark blood. Qhorin initiates a plan to install Jon as a spy within the [[Free Folk|wildling]] ranks.\n\n[[Grenn]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] discover a cache of [[dragonglass]] weapons at the [[Fist of the First Men]]. Jon's absence has been noted, but Sam refuses to believe that he is dead.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\nSer [[Jorah Mormont]] advises [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to leave her dragons and flee [[Qarth]]. She insists on attempting to reclaim them and asks Ser Jorah to lead her to the [[House of the Undying]], where she must endure a strange mystical maze to get to them.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n===In the Seven Kingdoms===\n[[File:Theon and Dagmer.jpg|thumb|Theon gives Dagmer a pouch of gold to compensate for the killing of the orphans.]]\n[[Yara Greyjoy]] arrives at [[Winterfell]] with a small band of men, but instead of bringing reinforcements she offers [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] only advice. Winterfell is too far from the sea, they can't successfully defend it with so few soldiers, and the North is rising against him. She implores Theon to abandon the castle and return home with her, but he refuses to give up his prize. [[Dagmer]] tells Theon that after killing the orphans, he also murdered the farmer and his wife.\n[[File:Bran and Rickon Alive.jpg|thumb|Bran overhears Luwin and Osha]]\n[[Luwin]] spots [[Osha]] sneaking into the catacombs. He follows her inside, and she explains that after reaching the farm she doubled back, using a stream to mask their scent from the hounds. Luwin urges her not to tell Bran and Rickon about the children Theon had murdered, but Bran is sitting up listening to them.\n\n[[Stannis Baratheon]]'s fleet is closing in on [[King's Landing]]. Stannis tells [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] that he admires him and offers him the [[Hand of the King]] role once he takes back his throne. [[Tyrion Lannister]] scours history books seeking inspiration for his plans to defend the city. He takes advice from [[Bronn]] and [[Varys]] and decides to make use of the stocks of [[wildfire]]. King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] is full of bravado, but his mother is worried about letting him fight. She tries to ensure his safety by kidnapping the [[Prostitution|prostitute]] [[Ros]], believing that she is Tyrion's lover. Tyrion is relieved that [[Shae]] is safe but vows revenge against his sister. \n[[File:Jaqen_H'ghar_2x8_1.png|thumb|right|Arya gives Jaqen his own name]]\nLord [[Tywin Lannister]] is torn between needing to defend [[King's Landing]] and wanting to drive King [[Robb Stark]] from [[the Westerlands]]. He decides to march west, leaving [[Arya Stark]] at [[Harrenhal]] to serve his castellan, Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. Realizing that she has missed her chance to kill Tywin, Arya pressures the assassin [[Jaqen H'ghar]] into aiding her escape from Harrenhal. She forces him to help her by giving him his own name as the third death he promised. She will only revoke his name when he agrees to break her and her friends out of the fortress. Arya, Hot Pie, and Gendry walk through the gates at midnight, as Jaqen instructed. They escape Harrenhal, realizing that the guards have been killed.\n\nRobb is furious when he learns that his mother [[Catelyn Stark]] has freed his prized captive Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]. He tells her that she has betrayed him and orders her kept under guard. Catelyn has sent [[Brienne of Tarth]] to escort Jaime to King's Landing to exchange him for her daughters, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. Brienne uses a canoe to evade pursuit. Robb plans to relieve Winterfell by turning Theon's men against him with an offer of mercy, issuing his orders to the [[Ramsay Bolton|bastard of the Dreadfort]] through [[Roose Bolton]]. Robb seeks solace in the arms of Lady [[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]], ignoring his betrothal to [[House Frey]].\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Charles Dance]] as Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Liam Cunningham]] as Ser [[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Jack Gleeson]] as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as Prince [[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Richard Madden]] as King [[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as Prince [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[John Bradley]] as [[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Stephen Dillane]] as King [[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as [[Shae]]\n*[[Jerome Flynn]] as [[Bronn]]\n*[[Conleth Hill]] as Lord [[Varys]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Guest starring'''\n*[[Donald Sumpter]] as Maester [[Luwin]]\n*[[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]]\n*[[Oona Chaplin]] as Lady [[Talisa Maegyr]]\n*[[Michael McElhatton]] as Lord [[Roose Bolton]]\n*[[Tom Wlaschiha]] as [[Jaqen H'ghar]]\n*[[Rose Leslie]] as [[Ygritte]]\n*[[Simon Armstrong]] as [[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n*[[Gemma Whelan]] as Princess [[Yara Greyjoy]]\n*[[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Gendry]]\n*[[Gwendoline Christie]] as [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as [[Dagmer|Dagmer Cleftjaw]]\n*[[Ian Gelder]] as Ser [[Kevan Lannister]]\n*[[John Stahl]] as Lord [[Rickard Karstark]]\n*[[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]]\n*[[Ben Crompton]] as [[Eddison Tollett]]\n*[[Ben Hawkey]] as [[Hot Pie]]\n*[[Esme Bianco]] as [[Ros]]\n*[[Andy Beckwith]] as [[Rorge]]\n*[[Steven Cole]] as [[Kovarro]]\n*[[Edward Dogliani]] as [[Lord of Bones]]\n*[[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n*[[Gerard Jordan]] as [[Biter]]\n*[[Art Parkinson]] as Prince [[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Daniel Portman]] as [[Podrick Payne]]\n*[[Ian Whyte]] as Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]\n*[[Kerr Logan]] as [[Matthos Seaworth]]\n*[[Moe Dunford]] as a [[Stark messenger]]\n*[[Mark Byatt]] as a [[Lannister torturer]]\n*[[David Sheehan|David Sheenan]] (sic)&lt;!--credits definitely read David SheeNan and not David SheeHan--&gt; as a [[Stark guard (A Man Without Honor)|Stark guard]]\n*[[Aiden Condron]] as a [[Lannister captain]]\n*[[Ciaran McMahon]] as a [[Lannister soldier (The Prince of Winterfell)|Lannister soldier]]\n\n'''Uncredited'''\n*Unknown as an [[Ironborn lookout]]\n*Unknown as a [[Tortured Lannister]]\n*Unknown as the [[Fury gunnery officer]]\n*Unknown as [[Lannister bannerman 1 (The Ghost of Harrenhal)|Lannister bannerman 1]]\n*Unknown as [[Lannister bannerman 2 (The Ghost of Harrenhal)|Lannister bannerman 2]]\n*Unknown as [[Lannister bannerman 3 (The Ghost of Harrenhal)|Lannister bannerman 3]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n*Only 19 of the 25 starring cast members for the second season appear in this episode.\n*Starring cast members [[James Cosmo]] ([[Jeor Mormont]]), [[Natalie Dormer]] ([[Margaery Tyrell]]), [[Aidan Gillen]] ([[Petyr Baelish]]), [[Rory McCann]] ([[Sandor Clegane]]), [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark]]), and [[Carice van Houten]] ([[Melisandre]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n*[[Jack Gleeson]] is credited ahead of [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]], [[Richard Madden]], [[Maisie Williams]] and [[Alfie Allen]] when he was credited after them when they last appeared together in &quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]].&quot;\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] is credited ahead of [[Jerome Flynn]] and [[Conleth Hill]] when she was credited after them when they last appeared together in &quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]].&quot;\n*Guest star [[David Sheehan]]'s name is spelled incorrectly in the credits as David Sheenan.\n\n", "Notes": "*[[Yara Greyjoy]] refers to her brother [[Theon Greyjoy]] as the [[Prince of Winterfell]] in dialogue.

But maybe it was.

In the books, Talisa's equivalent character is Jayne Westerling, a noblewoman from a minor Lannister vassal family, House Westerling. This is the only scene in which Talisa ever explains her altered backstory, but the changes do not appear to be fully researched and contain several contradictions:\n**Robb Stark is around 18 years old in Season 1, because he was conceived at the start of Robert's Rebellion, which ended 17 years ago (increasing his age in the books by two years). Numerous other times in the TV series itself, characters have mentioned that Westeros is at the end of a very long summer which has lasted for 10 years (the start of autumn was officially announced in the Season 2 premiere). When Talisa describes her backstory, she says that she and her brother went to bathe in the Rhoyne River when she was 12 years old, because it was the hottest day in the &quot;three year summer&quot;. The 10 year long summer that ended in the Season 2 premiere began when Robb was around 9 years old. It is possible (though unlikely) that an autumn/winter/spring cycle quickly occurred during a single year, preceded by a three-year long summer (the seasons are not regular). In which case this incident could have occurred no more than 11 years ago when Robb was around 5 to 6 years old. Talisa, however, states that she was 12 at the time, meaning she would have to be ''at least'' five to six years older than Robb. In the books, Jeyne Westerling is roughly the same age as Robb Stark, and while Talisa in the TV continuity is a separate character, the actors playing Robb and Talisa were actually born within two weeks of each other. When the writers developed this altered backstory for &quot;Talisa&quot; including an off-hand mention of a &quot;three year summer&quot;, they apparently didn't consider that the ''current'' summer lasted for ten full years.\n**The nobles and slaves of Volantis never mingle, and they are one of the most segregated of the Free Cities. On the other hand, Talisa's story somewhat implies that she and her brother sneaked off because their parents were away at a wedding and they weren't supposed to be in mixed company at the river, and this was just an exceptional incident in which all classes mingled at the river due to a heatwave.\n**Talisa says that drummers were playing for &quot;coppers&quot; on the east bank of the river. &quot;Copper Pennies&quot; are a [[Currency]] of the Seven Kingdoms, not Volantis. The Seven Kingdoms use the Gold Dragon coin, of which Silver Stags and Copper Pennies are smaller denominations. Volantis uses round gold coins called &quot;honors&quot; - there may be smaller Volantene denominations made of copper, but they have not been mentioned in the books.\n**Talisa's speech does, however, accurately relate a detail from the books, that slaves in Volantis are given facial tattoos so people can recognize them just by looking at them.\n\n", "Recap": ":''Main: [[The Prince of Winterfell recap]]''\nA detailed recap of the episode scene by scene.\n\n", "Appearances": ":''Main: [[The Prince of Winterfell/Appearances]]''\n===First===\n* The [[Lord of Bones]]\n\n===Deaths===\n*[[Borba]] (mentioned)\n*[[Harker]] (mentioned)\n*[[Stonesnake]] (mentioned)\n*Unidentified Lannister guards\n\n"}, "title": "The Prince of Winterfell"}
