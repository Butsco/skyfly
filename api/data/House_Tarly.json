During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Randyll Tarly was the only royalist general to win a decisive victory over [[Robert Baratheon]], defeating his army at the Battle of Ashford despite being outnumbered. Randyll's skills were later squandered during the fruitless [[Siege of Storm's End]], while Robert and [[Eddard Stark]] won great victories further north.\n\nLord Randyll is a hard, ruthless man. When his son Samwell showed a preference for songs, poetry, fine clothes and good food over martial valor and a love of warfare, Randyll disinherited him and sent him to [[the Wall]] to join the Night's Watch.
