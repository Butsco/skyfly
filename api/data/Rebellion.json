It resulted in the complete elimination of House Reyne and the destruction of Castamere at the orders of [[Tywin Lannister]]. House Lannister's victory is immortalized in the song &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;.\n* [[Robert's Rebellion]] was a major uprising against the royal house that turned into civil war as it involved eight of the nine great houses of [[Westeros]]. Houses [[Baratheon]], [[Stark]], [[Arryn]] and [[Tully]] rebelled against [[House Targaryen]], which was supported by Houses [[Tyrell]] and [[Martell]]. The tide of war turned against the royal house after the [[Battle of the Trident]] while the fate of the royal family was sealed when [[House Lannister]] joined the rebels and carried out the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. It resulted in the elevation of [[Robert Baratheon]] to the [[Iron Throne]].\n* The [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] was an uprising led by [[Balon Greyjoy]], [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]], who crowned himself [[King of the Iron Islands]] with the goal of seceding his domain from the Seven Kingdoms and restoring the [[ironborn]]'s [[Old Way (ironborn)|Old Way]]. It resulted in defeat of the rebels and the cementing of Robert's authority.\n* The [[War of the Five Kings]] involves several rebellions against the Iron Throne. Both [[the North]] and [[Iron Islands]] rebel against King [[Joffrey]] with the goal of independence. In the meantime, both [[Renly]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]] are held as rebels and pretenders as they both lay claim to the crown in defiance of Joffrey, who is held as the rightful heir of the late Robert.\n\n== \u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Image\u00c2\u00a0gallery==\n\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;&lt;gallery&gt;\nReyneRebellion.png|Image depicting [[House Reyne]]'s rebellion against [[House Lannister]].\nRobert's Rebellion Title Sequence.png|Part of the [[title sequence]] depicting [[Robert's Rebellion]] against [[House Targaryen]] and the [[Mad King]].\nGreyjoy Rebellion.png|Image depicting the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].\nBalon kneels.png|[[Balon Greyjoy]] bends the knee to King [[Robert Baratheon]], signalling the end of his rebellion.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Rebellion"}
