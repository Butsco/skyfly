Apparently, putting a fox on your banners doesn't impart the foxiest wiles.|Margaery Tyrell|The Reach (Histories &amp; Lore)}}\n\n'''House Florent''' is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Tyrell]] of [[Highgarden]]. Their seat is [[Brightwater Keep]]. The head of the house holds the title of Lord of Brightwater Keep. The Florent sigil is a red gold fox's head on an ermine background.\n\nHouse Florent had close ties to [[House Gardener]] when they were the [[Kings of the Reach]] prior to the [[Wars of Conquest]]. [[House Tyrell]] were installed as [[Warden]]s of the South after King [[Mern Gardener]] was killed fighting [[Aegon the Conqueror]]. House Florent resents the elevation of House Tyrell and believe they have a more valid claim to the position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/brightwater-keep/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Brightwater Keep entry]&lt;/ref&gt; They are fighting for [[Stannis Baratheon]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Blackwater (episode)|Blackwater]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Florents, like the Tyrells, claim descent from the extinct House Gardener, the royal line of the defunct Kings of the Reach. The Florents are known to chafe at the fealty owed to House Tyrell. The Florents believe that they have a superior line of descent, and by rights should possess Highgarden. While many Houses in the Reach can claim some descent from House Gardener, the Florents were a [[cadet branch]] of the Gardeners (descended from a younger son), while the Tyrells can only claim descent from the Gardeners through the female line. Physically, Florents are known for having large and prominent ears.\n\nThe [[Heraldry]] of House Florent in the books is inconsistently described, but apparently consists of a red-gold fox's head, encircled by lapis lazuli flowers, all of which is on an ermine background. The TV version simply omits the lapis lazuli flowers (and predominantly shows a full-bodied fox).\n\nDuring the [[War of the Five Kings]], the Florents initially declare for [[Renly Baratheon]] along with the rest of the noble Houses in the Reach, but following the latter's assassination, they defy the Tyrells and join [[Stannis Baratheon]], becoming one of the few Houses of the Reach not to join their Tyrell overlords in switching their allegiance to House Lannister.\n\n===Members===\n*Lord {Alester Florent}, Lord of Brightwater.
