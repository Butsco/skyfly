She is portrayed by guest star [[Nell Tiger Free]], taking over the role (starting in Season 5) from [[Aimee Richardson]], who played the character in Seasons 1 and 2. Princess Myrcella is commonly thought to be the only daughter of King [[Robert Baratheon]] and Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]. Like her siblings, her real father is [[Jaime Lannister]]. Her younger brother [[Tommen Baratheon]] currently sits on the [[Iron Throne]] as the [[King of the Andals and the First Men]]. She has been sent to [[Dorne]] as part of a marriage pact with [[House Martell]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Myrcella is a quiet, obedient, and honest girl, eight years old when the events of the books begin. Myrcella is a year younger than [[Arya Stark]], and a year older than [[Bran Stark]]. She is said to have inherited her mother's beautiful looks, but none of her personality. Her mother dotes on her and is keen that she does not suffer Cersei's fate of being &quot;sold&quot; in a political marriage without love.\n\nLike all of Cersei's children she was mostly ignored by King Robert. While Cersei felt she doted on all of her children, she is more attached to her own mental constructs of them than the reality. As Cersei's loveless marriage with Robert dragged on year after year, she increasingly fantasized about how Joffrey would one day succeed Robert and become a great king himself, never acknowledging that he was really a petulant sociopath. Ironically, despite Cersei's defiant claims (and even earnest belief) that she is a devoted mother to all of her children, she actually became so obsessed with Joffrey (and her fantasies about him) that she ''all but ignored'' Myrcella and Tommen throughout their lives. From the moment she gave birth to Joffrey, Cersei dreamed about the great king he would grow into, and how as Jaime's secret son he would be her ultimate revenge on Robert: the births of her two subsequent children were barely an anecdote in the narrative of this mental fantasy which already been established in her mind years before. Her younger children were pushed off to the side, and with Robert a non-factor in their lives as well, they were functionally raised by court servants, such as Septa [[Eglantine]]. Even so, Cersei will still become hypocritically enraged when anyone questions her relationship with her younger children.\n\nTV viewers who haven't read the books may find it odd that while the children of the current generation of House Stark are given a large amount of screentime (even Arya or Bran), the younger children of the current generation of House Lannister barely appear at all. This is much as it was in the earlier books of the series, and is actually a key plot point: the almost total absence of Myrcella and Tommen from the inner dynamics of House Lannister is indicative of just how little importance they have to Cersei. People are aware they exist, but rarely even pause to consider treating them as individuals with their own emotions or agendas (between the two of them, they had only a ''single'' throwaway speaking line in the entire first season, &quot;is Bran going to die?&quot; - [[Rickon Stark]] had more dialogue in Season 1 than both of them combined). At best, Cersei will argue over their treatment on general principle, such as when she opposed &quot;selling&quot; Myrcella of to a political marriage in Dorne. However, Cersei was more angered in the sense that she felt something was being taken which ''belonged'' to her: notice that neither the books nor TV series includes a scene in which\u00c2\u00a0Cersei discusses news of the marriage proposal with Myrcella.\n\nThus it is all the more shocking when in later books, as they grow older, Myrcella and Tommen increasingly turn into major characters in the very midst of House Lannister, on the scale of Arya or Bran Stark, where before they were treated as non-entities. The other family members and courtiers (and by extension, the readers or TV viewers) are even criticized for ignoring them this entire time, and simply assuming they were content. The smiling children seen in public at the [[Tourney of the Hand]] in book/Season 1 hide a darker and empty family life. Later books also retroactively reveal that Tommen, and maybe Myrcella too, have lived in terror of Joffrey their entire lives. Joffrey killed and skinned a pet fawn of Tommen, yet Cersei continued to dote on him. At one point Tommen even says that he used to &quot;go away inside&quot; mentally when Joffrey did certain things to him, though the exact extent of what he did (killing his pet or something far more sinister) has not been made clear. It is not mentioned or implied if Joffrey abused Myrcella too.\n\nHowever, despite their parents' loveless marriage, absent father, sociopathic and abusive older brother, willfully blind and functionally absent mother, Myrcella and Tommen still seem to have a good and genuinely loving relationship between the two of them, as fellow-sufferers sharing a household with Cersei and Joffrey.\n\nTommen goes to the tournament for Joffrey's nameday, having been given permission by Cersei to do a practice mounted sword fight against a quintain with a straw filled mannequin as his opponent. Joffrey sees that the quality of the jousting is poor (the Hound says they are all gnats, and Ser [[Dontos Hollard]] shows up drunk), and Joffrey decides to cancel the whole thing. Tommen and Myrcella protest, as Cersei said Tommen could take part, and Joffrey can't just cancel it. When Joffrey says they are acting childish, Myrcella responds, &quot;We are children. We are supposed to act childish.&quot; The Hound laughs and says, &quot;She's got you there&quot;, and Joffrey relents.\n\nMyrcella doesn't cry when she is sent away on the ship to Dorne. In fact, she comforts Tommen, who is crying. Myrcella's ship actually doesn't sail directly to Dorne, but rather, sails to the Free City of [[Braavos]] across the [[Narrow Sea]], in order to meet on neutral ground. When they reach Braavos, Myrcella and her attendants are received by Dornish envoys, who in turn transport them back across the Narrow Sea to Dorne.\n\nAfter Joffrey is poisoned at [[Purple Wedding|his own wedding]], several Martell characters remark that they are baffled at how Cersei doted on her psychotic eldest son to the exclusion of her younger children, when Myrcella is actually the kind of born ruler that Joffrey never was. While Cersei barely paid attention to her daughter, the Martells discover that she is preternaturally more intelligent than many adults (despite being only eleven years old), brave from living through Joffrey's torments, as well as kind and a natural leader due to defending her little brother Tommen from Joffrey when she could. They also find her to be quick-witted, and with a polite courtesy that Cersei never expressed. Just as Tyrion was the only one of Tywin's three children to inherit his keen mind, Myrcella was the only one of Cersei's three children to inherit the famous intellect running in the family - meaning that Myrcella is essentially the intellect of Tywin or Tyrion put in the beautiful body of a young, teenaged Cersei, combined with Tyrion's sympathy for the downtrodden.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Myrcella&quot; is pronounced &quot;Mer-SELL-uh&quot;, as opposed to &quot;MER-sull-uh&quot; (that is, it doesn't rhyme with &quot;Ursula&quot;).\n\n", "Quotes": "'''Quotes by Myrcella'''\n{{Quote|Is [[Brandon Stark|Bran]] going to die?|'''Myrcella Baratheon''' to her uncle Tyrion (also, Myrcella's first and only speaking line in Season 1)|The Kingsroad}}\n\n{{dialogue a-b-c|Joffrey Baratheon|We heard you were dead.|Myrcella Baratheon|I'm glad you're not dead.|Tyrion Lannister|Me too, dear.

Myrcella says that she is excited for the new gowns she will wear to the wedding. She good-naturedly points out that Sansa will be wearing an ivory gown as the bride.

Queen Cersei is furious with Tyrion when she hears (from [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]]) what he is planning, declaring that she won't let her only daughter be shipped off to Dorne as she was shipped off to Robert Baratheon. Tyrion counters that as a princess, many would say that Myrcella was born to one day forge a marriage alliance, and she will be safer in Dorne than in the capital city during a major civil war.

Oberyn\u00c2\u00a0introduces his [[paramour]], [[Ellaria Sand]], to Myrcella's mother Cersei. The four of them exchange smiling pleasantries which barely hide their underlying and mutual loathing for each other. At the end of their encounter, Oberyn casually points out that Myrcella is still in Dorne; while Oberyn hints that a [[ward]] can easily become nothing more than a\u00c2\u00a0[[hostage]], he also taunts Cersei and Tywin by stating that murdering little girls is frowned upon in Dorne. (The obvious implication is that Oberyn and his family are morally superior to the Lannisters and unwilling to hurt Myrcella for a political advantage despite the Lannisters killing House Martell's relatives for their own.) &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Tommen is crowned king after Joffrey is poisoned at his own wedding, making Myrcella the heir to the Iron Throne.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhile conversing with Oberyn, Cersei laments that she has not seen Myrcella in over a year. Oberyn informs her that the last time he saw Myrcella she was swimming with two of [[Sand Snakes|his daughters]] in the [[Water Gardens]], laughing in the sun. Cersei states that she wants to believe this story, and that Myrcella is happy. Oberyn gives her his word, stating again that they do not hurt little girls in Dorne. Cersei replies that they hurt little girls everywhere in the world. Cersei asks Oberyn to bring Myrcella a gift from her, as she missed her [[nameday]] and does not know when she will see her again. Oberyn agrees and Cersei points to a ship that the best shipwrights in King's Landing have been building for months, declaring that Myrcella loves the open water. Oberyn promises to have it sailed down to Sunspear for Myrcella. Cersei asks him to please tell Myrcella that her mother misses her very much.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Oberyn meets with Tyrion in his prison cell, and recounts his meeting with Cersei. Oberyn says he half-suspects that Cersei was actually lying, and was exaggerating how much she misses Myrcella in order to guilt him into siding with her against Tyrion during the trial - though her performance was so convincing that part of him also wonders if it was true. Tyrion explains that the trouble with Cersei is that she mixes lies with truth to suit her own ends: part of her is worried about Myrcella, but she isn't above cynically using this grief to gain sympathy from others.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mockingbird]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 5]]===\n\n"}, "title": "Myrcella Baratheon"}
