It flows into the [[Summer Sea]] just north of [[Lemonwood]]. The Greenblood is formed from the confluence of two other rivers, the [[Scourge]] and the [[Vaith (river)|Vaith]], which meet near the castle of [[Godsgrace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/dorne/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Dorne entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Greenblood serves as the primary transport and trade artery of eastern Dorne. The country's main port, the Planky Town, is located at the mouth of the river. Due to the desert environment of central and western Dorne, much of the population is concentrated in Dorne's few river valleys such as that of the Greenblood.\n\nIt is home to a unique gypsy-like culture known as the &quot;Orphans of the Greenblood&quot;, descended from some of the original [[Rhoynar]] who chose not to abandon any of their original culture from [[Essos]] when they migrated to Dorne. Most of the rest of the Rhoynar did partially assimilate, becoming the present-day Dornishmen. The Orphans of the Greenblood, however, remain a river-based trading society moving up and down the course of the river on boats, and still practicing the original religion of the Rhoynar centered on worshipping river-gods like Mother Rhoyne. In this sense, the Greenblood and its tributaries serve as replacements for the considerably larger [[Rhoyne]] and its many branches.\n\n"}, "title": "Greenblood"}
