As an adult, Christie is 6'3&quot; in height (192 cm). She almost reached her full adult height by the time she was only 14 years old, but rejected the growth inhibitors offered by her doctor. She attended Henfield Primary School, then Warden Park Secondary School, and has said her height made it difficult to fit in. With her real life &quot;very quiet, sedate, and bookish&quot;, she saw film as an exciting view of a wider world, and eventually moved to London to attend drama school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.net-a-porter.com/magazine/273/20 ]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nChristie had several minor roles in films such as ''[[wikipedia:The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus|The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'', before being cast as Brienne in ''Game of Thrones'', her first major role.\n\nSubsequently to joining ''Game of Thrones'', she has been cast in ''[[Wikipedia:The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; Part 2|The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; Part 2]]'' (alongside fellow ''Game of Thrones'' actress [[Natalie Dormer]]).

She was announced in the role by [[George R.R. Martin]] on 8 July 2011. She joined the cast as a guest star in the [[Season 2|second season]].\n\nChristie first heard about the role of Brienne of Tarth when a friend notified her that there was internet speculation that she was going to be cast in an HBO series (there are only so many 6'3&quot; tall actresses, thus Christie was on the short list of fansite speculation). In fact, Christie had never heard about it before, but this speculation led her to look up fansites and find out what ''Game of Thrones'' was, and about Brienne of Tarth. Christie fell in love with Brienne, read the books and everything about them, and subsequently sought out the role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.co.uk/television/game-of-thrones/video/gwendoline-christie-interview MTV Gwendoline Christie interview.]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nChristie attended the audition in character and wearing armor. According to George R.R. Martin, they decided on casting her quickly, noting: &quot;we looked at a dozen actresses who were reading for Brienne, and one actress who WAS Brienne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html GRRM's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; For her role as Brienne, Christie trained extensively to get into the right physical condition, as well as cutting off her long hair and reading all of the available novels to study her character's development in detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfx.co.uk/2012/04/11/game-of-thrones-gwendoline-christie-interview/ SFX Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; HBO also had Christie take horseriding lessons, and she was trained in swordfighting by C.C.
