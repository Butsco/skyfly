She enjoyed working on the show and found the large ensemble to be very well supported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redeyechicago.com/entertainment/tv/redeye-natalie-dormer-talks-the-fades-game-of-thrones-madonna-20120202,0,5417639.story Red Eye Chicago interview with Natalie Dormer&lt;/ref&gt; She is a new starring cast member for the [[Season 2|second season]].\n\nWhen asked if she thought Margaery was being insincere when she gave out food aid to the orphans and smallfolk of King's Landing in Season 3, Dormer said it was a mix of political pragmatism as well as legitimate concern for her subjects: &quot;It doesn't mean she's insincere. People can be quite cruel, I find, about Margaery: 'Oh, she's another malicious, calculating character who's after the Throne.' But I don't think in regards with her attitude to the public and her attitude to Sansa \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; she's not disingenuous. I don't see the two as mutually exclusive, as modern politicians themselves would say. I think she has a heart. I think she can be very sincere. I just think she's a pragmatist. She's been brought up by the Queen of Thorns, Lady Olenna, being played by Diana Rigg [stay tuned!], to be a shrewd politician \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; to be the ideal First Lady, as it were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/game-of-thrones-q-a-natalie-dormer-on-playing-the-kate-middleton-of-westeros-20130401 'Game of Thrones' Q&amp;A: Natalie Dormer on Playing 'the Kate Middleton of Westeros'], April 1st, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDormer reprised her role as Margaery in ''[[Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series]]''\n\nShe is not related to actor [[Richard Dormer]], who plays [[Beric Dondarrion]].\n", "Gallery": "&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; widths=&quot;350&quot; position=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n11493-actress-natalie-dormer-who-plays-1000x0-2.jpg\nnatalie-dormer-hair-2014-.jpg\nNatalie+Dormer+Game+of+Thrones+Roland+Mouret+Tom+Lorenzo+4.jpg\nc066403beb96dc7c0302fe936ce79891.jpg\ndormer_8.jpg\nnatalie-dormer-uk-film-premiere-of-the_3718491.jpg\nnatalie-dormer-uk-film-premiere-of-the_3718495.jpg\nNatalie+Dormer+Dresses+Skirts+Little+Black+V068ySMtUzLl.jpg\nnatalie-dormer-catchingpre6.jpg\nNatalie-Dormer-image-natalie-dormer-36091348-1800-1154.jpg\nnatalie-dormer.jpg\nNatalie-Dormer-1024x768.jpg\nnatalie-dormer-2013-ee-british-academy-film-awards-01.jpg\no-NATALIE-DORMER-570.jpg\n101769958-natalie-dormer.jpg\nNatalie-Dormer-2014-SAG-Awards3.jpg\nnatalie-dormer-chicago-comic-entertainment-expo-2013_3630917.jpg\nnatalie-dormer-chicago-comic-entertainment-expo-2013_3630920.jpg\nnatalie_dormer_2.jpg\nNatalie+Dormer+6th+Annual+Oscar+Wilde+Honoring+fUqhzA4ZPv4l.jpg\nNatalie+Dormer+Shoulder+Length+Hairstyles+IJ7_O2ydrXTl.jpg\nnatalie-dormer2_original.jpg\nNatalieDormer2014.jpg\nNatalieDormerPremiereHungerGamesBlog.jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{Template:WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 1754059}}\n\n"}, "title": "Natalie Dormer"}
