As a result of this, the Florents are surly and reluctant bannermen to the Tyrells.\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Blackwater, House Florent is [[Attainting|attainted]] by the [[Iron Throne]] and stripped of lands and titles. Brightwater Keep is granted to Ser [[Garlan Tyrell]], the second son of Lord [[Mace Tyrell]], who has been cut from the series so far.\n\n"}, "title": "Brightwater Keep"}
