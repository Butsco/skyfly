She is best known for her roles as [[wikipedia:Pride and Prejudice#Georgiana Darcy|Georgiana Darcy]] in [[wikipedia:Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005 film)|''Pride and Prejudice'']] and as [[wikipedia:Queen Catherine Howard|Catherine Howard]] in [[wikipedia:The Tudors (TV series)|''The Tudors'']].\n\nTamzin Merchant was originally cast in the role of [[Daenerys Targaryen]] on ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', a decision announced by [[HBO]] on 20 August 2009. She played the role in the pilot episode filmed in late 2009, with her scenes being filmed in [[wikipedia:Morocco|Morocco]]. However, rumors began circulating that Merchant was departing the project after casting sides for the role of Daenerys reappeared on 25 March 2010, after the series was picked up. Her departure was confirmed on 29 March and her replacement, [[Emilia Clarke]], was announced on 21 May. No official reason has been given for her departure, but [[George R.R. Martin]] reports that there were no problems with her performance in the role. Merchant went on to appear in the BBC miniseries ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''.\n\nIronically, while Merchant played Henry VIII's fifth wife Catherine Howard, in ''The Tudors'', [[Natalie Dormer]], who played his second wife Anne Boleyn, was later cast in [[Season 2]] in the major role of [[Margaery Tyrell]]. As is well-known from the rhyme, &quot;divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived&quot;, both Howard and Boleyn were ultimately beheaded.\n\nMartin himself has expressed on his blog his own admiration for Merchant's performance as Catherine Howard.&lt;ref&gt;http://grrm.livejournal.com/153015.html&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMerchant and [[Harry Lloyd]] ([[Viserys Targaryen]]) also both had minor parts in film adaptation of ''[[wikipedia:Jane Eyre (2011 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' although they had no scenes together.\n\n", "See also": "* {{WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 1708957}}\n\n"}, "title": "Tamzin Merchant"}
