They rule Bear Island, an island far to the north-west of Winterfell. The head of the house is the [[Lord of Bear Island]]. The family possessed the Valyrian sword [[Longclaw]], which later was given to [[Jon Snow]].\n\nHouse Mormont's sigil is a black bear in a green wood. Their motto is '''&quot;Here We Stand&quot;. '''\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Mormont is a stalwart supporter of the Starks. According to legend, King [[Rodrik Stark]] won the island in a wrestling match (presumably with the ironborn lord who held the island at the time) and appointed the Mormonts to rule there.\n\nBear Island is beautiful, but also icy, cold and remote. The Mormont &quot;castle&quot; is a large, comfortable but still relatively primitive wooden longhouse (due to a lack of stone on the island). Bears still prowl the woods of the island, giving the Mormonts their sigil. The people of Bear Island are fierce, hardy and strong. Unlike most of [[Westeros]], the women of Bear Island are trained in the use of weapons and armor, as they are expected to defend hearth and home should [[wildling]] raiders from the Frozen Shore to the north attack.\n\nIn the books, Lord Jeor Mormont ruled the house honorably and with distinction. He chose to 'retire' from the role of lord and took the black, joining the [[Night's Watch]] and rising rapidly through their ranks until he became Lord Commander, a rank he holds to this day. Jeor felt able to do this as his son [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] had proven to be a great warrior, winning immense honors during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] and the following tourney. Lord Jorah proved an effective ruler for several years, until he disgraced himself in an incident involving slavers. Lord [[Eddard Stark]] stripped him of his title and lands and Jorah fled to the [[Free Cities]] rather than face justice. Jeor's younger sister Maege became the ruling Lady of Bear Island the head of House Mormont, to Jeor's disquiet. However, as members of the Night's Watch serve for life he was unable to return to Bear Island to resume his former rule.\n\nLady Maege Mormont has since proven to be a strong and effective ruler of the House.\n\nDacey Mormont is the eldest of Maeger's five daughters and a proud warrior in her own right. She serves as one of Robb Stark's personal guard throughout the War of the Five Kings. Dacey is slain at the [[Red Wedding]]: she was one of the few Stark bannermen who survived the initial attack by the Frey crossbowmen, and managed to fend off another attacker by smashing a flagon of wine in his face. Just as she was about to reach the exist, Bolton men burst through the door in front of her along with Ryman Frey, who drove a longaxe into her belly.\n\n===Members===\n\n*Lord Commander Jeor Mormont - former head of the House, who voluntarily abdicated his position to join the [[Night's Watch]].\n**Ser Jorah Mormont - his son.
