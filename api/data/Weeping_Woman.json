She's depicted carrying a bowl filled by tears. Idols of the Weeping Woman trickle tears which fill the bowl.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Weeping Woman is also known as the Weeping Lady of [[Lys]]. The statue of the Weeping Lady found in the House of Black and White is made of marble and is 12 feet tall. It is commonly visited by old women.\n\nThe [[Lord of Light]] religion is the largest in Lys, though numerous other local cults exist in sizable numbers.  Aside from the Weeping Woman, a local love goddess is also very popular - so much that it is printed on Lysene coins, naked and wanton.  It isn't clear if the love goddess and the Weeping Woman are part of the same religion or from separate cults.\n\n"}, "title": "Weeping Woman"}
