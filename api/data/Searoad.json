It connects [[Casterly Rock]] and [[Lannisport]] in [[the Westerlands]] to the castle of [[Highgarden]] in [[the Reach]]. The Searoad passes through [[Crakehall]] and [[Old Oak]]. The road has to cross the [[Mander]] River to reach Highgarden, which is located on the southern bank of the river. At Highgarden the Searoad meets the [[Roseroad]], which heads north and east towards [[King's Landing]], and south to [[Oldtown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/casterly-rock/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Casterly Rock entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Searoad is in the same location. Curiously, the first four novels in the series label is the &quot;Searoad&quot;, as does the official map for HBO's TV series adaptation. However, the map accompanying the fifth novel, ''A Dance With Dragons'', inexplicably labels it the &quot;Ocean Road&quot;. It's not clear if this is an alternate name, or a mistake in publication.\n\n"}, "title": "Searoad"}
