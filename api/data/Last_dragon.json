It's death marked the extinction of [[dragons]] in [[Westeros]] and beyond until the birth of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s dragons.\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the last dragon was a green female who died during the reign of King [[Aegon III Targaryen]], who earned the nickname &quot;The Dragonbane&quot; as he was blamed for her death. She was sickly, small, misshapen and stunted, with withered wings. Her name is not known.\nAlthough she was sickly she did lay a clutch of five eggs, which never hatched.\n\nIn ''The Hedge Knight'', the first of the ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' prequel novellas, Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] remembers his late mentor Ser Arlan of [[Pennytree]] telling him that he had seen the last dragon when he was a child.\n\nWhen [[Tyrion Lannister]] views the nineteen dragon skulls stored in a dank cellar in [[King's Landing]] he recalls seeing a matched pair of skulls, no bigger than mastiff\u00e2&euro;&trade;s skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. He thinks to himself that they were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long. He remembers telling his uncle Gerion as a child that he wanted a pet dragon, but Gerion only laughed and told him that the last one had died over a century ago.\n\n", "Biography": "\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;At [[Vaes Dothrak]], [[Viserys Targaryen]] bathes with [[Doreah]] and she tells him that she wants to see a dragon more than anything and asks if he has seen one. He replies that he has not, as the last one died many years before he was born. He tells her that he saw their skulls when he was a child, as they were used to decorate the [[Red Keep]]. He tells her that the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch. He says that they were stunted and wrong, their skulls no bigger than a dog's.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Petyr Baelish]] believes that the last dragon's death was a precursor of the eventual downfall of the Targaryens.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Robert's Rebellion (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Last dragon"}
