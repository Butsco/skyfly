After the death of Harren the Black and his sons, [[Aegon the Conqueror]] granted the castle to [[House Qoherys]] as a reward for its loyalty until the line died out. The following families to rule Harrenhal were the [[House Towers|Towers]], [[House Harroway|Harroways]], [[House Strong|Strongs]], and [[House Lothston|Lothstons]], all of which became extinct, leading to the popular belief that the castle is cursed. Following House Lothston, the [[House Whent|Whents]] become the new Lords of Harrenhal, until the castle is occupied by [[House Lannister]] during the early stage of the [[War of the Five Kings]], while Lady [[Shella Whent]] flees from it.\n\nThe title of Lord of Harrenhal is then awarded to [[Janos Slynt]], commander of the [[City Watch]] of [[King's Landing]], for his role in the betrayal and arrest of [[Eddard Stark]]. Thus, the newly created [[House Slynt]] displaces the nigh-extinct House Whent. However, Lord Janos never takes possession of Harrenhal, as he's stripped of lands and title and exiled to [[the Wall]].\n\n[[Tyrion Lannister]] then offers the title to [[Petyr Baelish]] in exchange for his aid in the liberation of Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], along with the title of Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. However, Baelish obtains Harrenhal from the hands of King [[Joffrey]] as a reward for arranging an alliance between Houses Lannister and [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]].\n\n"}, "title": "Lord of Harrenhal"}
