There are vague legends that a single First Man that Old Nan refers to in her stories as &quot;the last hero&quot; unified both the First Men and the Children of the Forest and led them to victory. According to [[Melisandre]], there are also stories and legends of the Long Night in [[Essos]]. They refer to the &quot;last hero&quot; as &quot;Azor Ahai&quot;.
