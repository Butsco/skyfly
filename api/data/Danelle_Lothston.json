She's also known as '''Mad Lady Lothston''' and is the stuff of tales and horror stories.\n\nAccording to tales, Mad Lady Lothston cooked children, which she captured by sending a giant bat - the sigil of House Lothston - out of the castle of [[Harrenhal]], bathed in blood, and served feasts of human flesh.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Harrenhal (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "\nIn the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mad Danelle's backstory is the same. She ruled Harrenhal during the reign of Aerys I and was a loyal vassal of the [[Iron Throne]]. She had long red hair and wore tight-fitting black armor.\n\nThe Lothstons held Harrenhal during the time of the ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' prequel novellas, with Mad Lady Lothston\u00c2\u00a0herself appearing in the third story in the series, ''The Mystery Knight''\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;. Thus she\u00c2\u00a0might appear in any potential adaptation of the prequels.\n\nThe legends about Mad Lady Lothston bathing in the blood of slain children are loosely similar to the real-life seventeenth century Hungarian noblewoman [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory Elizabeth B\u0102\u0104thory].\n\n"}, "title": "Danelle Lothston"}
