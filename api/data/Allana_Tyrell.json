She is the cousin of [[Margaery Tyrell]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels there is no character named\u00c2\u00a0Allana, either of House Tyrell or any other house. \n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nAllana is a member of [[House Tyrell]].\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nAllana is mentioned by her cousin Margaery while chatting with [[Sansa Stark]]. According to Margaery, when she was 12, she was very clumsy and Allana looked like a goddess sent to torture her. Allana used to call Margaery &quot;Pig-face&quot;, and whenever she passed Margaery in the halls, she'd oink, so Margaery prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. Margaery tells Sansa that a week after that, Allana came down with &quot;porridge plague&quot;. Only when Margaery bursts out laughing, Sansa understands it is a joke. Sansa asks what has become of Allana, and Margaery answers that she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. Margaery finds this very frustrating, but Sansa assures her that Allana must be very jealous of her, now that she is going to become a queen. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Allana Tyrell"}
