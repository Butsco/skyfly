Autumn has fallen across the world, with winter not far behind. The people should be preparing for years of snow and ice, but the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]] instead remain gripped by [[War of the Five Kings|civil war]]. Would-be king [[Renly Baratheon]] has been [[Assassination of Renly I|assassinated]], altering the alliances in the war. The cruel boy-king [[Joffrey Baratheon]] has won a great victory by securing an alliance with [[House Tyrell]], with his supporters defeating his uncle [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] in an [[Battle of the Blackwater|epic battle]]. Joffrey now commands the largest armies in the realm and his triumph appears inevitable.\n\nKing [[Robb Stark]] remains in the field, however his homeland, [[the North]], is partially under [[ironborn]] occupation. Robb needs to decide on a course of action to win an overall victory. He must also win back the allegiance of [[House Frey]], whom he has offended by breaking his marriage pact to them. King Robb has won every battle he has fought, but as with old King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], the Starks will have to see if good soldiers make good kings.\n\nStannis Baratheon may be defeated and most of his army destroyed or scattered, but he is not out of the fight yet. Having retreated to his headquarters on [[Dragonstone]] island with his handful of surviving soldiers, Stannis' status as the last legitimate heir to his older brother Robert still casts a shadow over Joffrey's claim to the throne. With the priestess [[Melisandre]] at his side, Stannis can still influence the course of the war by striking where least expected.\n\nThe lives of many others still hang in the balance. [[Bran Stark]] and his protectors must cross the frozen wastelands of the North to reach [[the Wall]], while [[Arya Stark|Arya]] must brave the war-torn [[the Riverlands|Riverlands]] in search of her mother and brother. [[Brienne]] also has the thankless task of taking the captive [[Jaime Lannister]] home across hundreds of miles of battlefields and carnage. [[Theon Greyjoy]] must face the consequences of his actions at [[Winterfell]]. And in [[King's Landing]] both [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Sansa Stark]] must brave the currents of a much more dangerous court in order to survive.\n\nOn the [[Essos|eastern continent]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has fled the political viper-pit of [[Qarth]]. Her [[dragons]] are growing and her fame is spreading, but to take the [[Iron Throne]] she will need supporters and an army. Both may be found in the corrupt cities of [[Slaver's Bay]]... for a price.\n\n[[Beyond the Wall]], the [[White Walkers]] are on the move, threatening both the Seven Kingdoms and the lands of the [[Free Folk]]. While the [[Night's Watch]] faces the threat of the White Walkers in the field, [[Jon Snow]] must infiltrate the wildling army of [[Mance Rayder]] and discover the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]'s plans.\n\n", "Media release": "Season 3 of ''Game of Thrones'' was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States on February 17th, 2014.

Production in the new location of Morocco filmed [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s new storyline in [[Slaver's Bay]] as well as some King's Landing exterior shots.\n\nThe scene from the episode &quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot; during which Brienne of Tarth is thrown into a bear pit at [[Harrenhal]] involved a real trained stunt bear, [[Bart the Bear]]. Due to are various legal restrictions on international transport of large animals such as bears, parts of this scene were ''technically'' filmed in Los Angeles in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/01/nikolaj-coster-waldau-confirms-two-more-days-of-shooting/ WinterIsComing.net], January 28th, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, aa the in-episode guide explains, the sets and actors were still in Northern Ireland, and never filmed in Los Angeles. Rather, a stunt man in a green-screen suit stood in for the bear on-set in Northern Ireland so the actors would have the proper eye-line, and the actor-bear was filmed in his sanctuary in Los Angeles, while his trainer walked him through the required motions for the scene. The actor-bear's footage was then digitally integrated into the shots with the human actors. Thus, no part of any &quot;location&quot; or set filmed in the United States was present on-screen, ''only'' the bear's body. The production team usually spoke of production extending across four countries in Season 2, so Bart's brief appearance wasn't counted.\n\nFilming in Season 1 included locations in Northern Ireland and Malta, but filming did not return to Malta in subsequent seasons. The Targaryen storyline in [[Pentos]] was filmed in the Maltese presidential palace (as well as a few other scenes for King's Landing). Maltese officials were reportedly annoyed that a nude scene was filmed in the palace (Daenerys's bath in the first episode), which may have influenced why production did not return to that country.\n\nSeason 2 expanded to film in Croatia and Iceland, and filming continued in those two countries through Season 3 and Season 4. In Season 3 production expanded to Morocco, but did not return to Morocco for Season 4.\n\nThe result is that the production on Season 3 was a monumental, international effort involving units and cast members which were filming ''simultaneously'' in four separate countries. The series has filmed in five countries overall, but filming in Malta ended before production expanded to the other three countries. This number increases to six if one counts the footage of the actor-bear used in Season 3. Because filming did not return to Morocco in Season 4, this makes Season 3 the most widespread international filming project that the TV series has engaged in to date.\n\n===Cast===\n:''Main article: [[Season 3 cast]]''\n\n====Starring cast====\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]] (9 episodes)\n*[[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] (7 episodes)\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Richard Madden]] as King [[Robb Stark]] (7 episodes)\n*[[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Charles Dance]] as Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Liam Cunningham]] as Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Stephen Dillane]] as King [[Stannis Baratheon]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Carice van Houten]] as Lady [[Melisandre]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Natalie Dormer]] as Lady [[Margaery Tyrell]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as Prince [[Bran Stark]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Sophie Turner]] as Princess [[Sansa Stark]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]] (9 episodes)\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as Prince [[Theon Greyjoy]] (6 episodes)\n*[[John Bradley]] as [[Samwell Tarly]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Oona Chaplin]] as Queen [[Talisa Stark]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Gendry]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Jack Gleeson]] as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] (7 episodes)\n*[[Rose Leslie]] as [[Ygritte]] (8 episodes)\n*[[James Cosmo]] as Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Jerome Flynn]] as Ser [[Bronn]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Conleth Hill]] as Lord [[Varys]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as [[Shae]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Rory McCann]] as [[Sandor Clegane]] (8 episodes)\n\n====Selected guest starring cast====\n*[[Nathalie Emmanuel]] as [[Missandei]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Ian McElhinney]] as Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] (8 episodes)\n*[[Gwendoline Christie]] as [[Brienne of Tarth]] (7 episodes)\n*[[Kristofer Hivju]] as [[Tormund|Tormund Giantsbane]] (7 episodes)\n*[[Michael McElhatton]] as Lord [[Roose Bolton]] (7 episodes)\n*[[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]] as [[Jojen Reed]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Mackenzie Crook]] as [[Orell]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Paul Kaye]] as [[Thoros|Thoros of Myr]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Philip McGinley]] as [[Anguy]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Hannah Murray]] as [[Gilly]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Iwan Rheon]] as [[Ramsay Snow]] (6 episodes)\n*[[Jacob Anderson]] as [[Grey Worm]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Finn Jones]] as Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Ellie Kendrick]] as [[Meera Reed]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Tobias Menzies]] as Lord [[Edmure Tully]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Daniel Portman]] as [[Podrick Payne]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Diana Rigg]] as Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Clive Russell]] as Ser [[Brynden Tully]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Noah Taylor]] as [[Locke]] (5 episodes)\n*[[Luke McEwan|Luke Barnes]] as [[Rast]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Esme Bianco|Esm\u0102\u0160 Bianco]] as [[Ros]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Ben Crompton]] as [[Eddison Tollett]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Richard Dormer]] as Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Anton Lesser]] as [[Qyburn]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Art Parkinson]] as Prince [[Rickon Stark]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]] (4 episodes)\n*[[Julian Glover]] as [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] (3 episodes)\n*[[Dan Hildebrand]] as [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]] (3 episodes)\n*[[Ciar\u0102\u0104n Hinds]] as [[Mance Rayder]] (3 episodes)\n*[[Ed Skrein]] as [[Daario Naharis]] (3 episodes)\n*[[John Stahl]] as Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] (3 episodes)\n*[[Ian Beattie]] as Ser [[Meryn Trant]] (2 episodes)\n*[[David Bradley]] as Lord [[Walder Frey]] (2 episodes)\n*[[Ben Hawkey]] as [[Hot Pie]] (2 episodes)\n*[[Kerry Ingram]] as Princess [[Shireen Baratheon]] (2 episodes)\n*[[Robert Pugh]] as [[Craster]] (2 episodes)\n*[[Josef Altin]] as [[Pypar]] (&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;)\n*[[Tara Fitzgerald]] as Queen [[Selyse Baratheon]] (&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;)\n*[[Patrick Malahide]] as King [[Balon Greyjoy]] (&quot;Mhysa&quot;)\n*[[Lucian Msamati]] as [[Salladhor Saan]] (&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;)\n*[[Peter Vaughan]] as [[Maester]] [[Aemon]] (&quot;Mhysa&quot;)\n*[[Gemma Whelan]] as Princess [[Yara Greyjoy]] (&quot;Mhysa&quot;)\n\n===Crew===\nDirector and producer [[Alan Taylor]] will not be returning due to his commitments on the film ''[[wikipedia: Thor: The Dark World| Thor: The Dark World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Taylor_Out_Nutter_Returns/ &quot;Taylor Out Nutter Returns&quot;], Westeros.org&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Credits====\n* [[David Benioff]]: executive producer\n* [[D.B.
