He initially appeared as a recurring character in the [[Season 1|first season]], debuting in &quot;[[You Win or You Die]]&quot;, and will appear again as a corpse in the [[Season 5|fifth season]]. He is played by starring cast member [[Charles Dance]]. Tywin Lannister is the head of [[House Lannister]], [[Lord of Casterly Rock]], [[Warden]] of the West, [[Lord Paramount of the Westerlands]], [[Hand of the King]] on two occasions, and [[Protector of the Realm]]. He is the father of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]].\n\nIntelligent, calculating, ruthless and intimidating, Tywin is the richest man in Westeros and effectively the most powerful when he serves as Hand of the King to his grandsons [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. His driving force is to secure his legacy and that of the Lannister name, and will do whatever he considers necessary to protect the family. Tywin is often at odds with his three children, whom he considers a disappointment. His mistreatment of Tyrion eventually results in Tyrion [[Assassination at the Tower of the Hand|killing him]]\u00c2\u00a0in cold blood, after the former is sentenced to death for a murder he did not commit.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tywin is a ruthless, pragmatic leader and a formidable general and strategist, although he prefers to orchestrate events from behind the scenes rather than leading from the front. His father, [[Tytos Lannister|Lord Tytos]], was a weak ruler who was mocked by many of his vassals. When House Reyne of Castamere and House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall rose against House Lannister, young Tywin led his House's armies and crushed the revolt. He was the [[Hand of the King]] under King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] for twenty years before a series of insults saw him resign the position. Tywin's term in office as Hand of the King was very successful, to the point that he was essentially the only man holding the kingdom together as Aerys II grew increasingly more insane over the years. The TV series does not state this, but the reason the Mad King had [[Ilyn Payne]]'s tongue torn from his mouth with hot irons was because he overheard Payne remarking that Tywin was the ''real'' ruler of the kingdoms. After Tywin resigned and returned home to Casterly Rock, Aerys II's rule rapidly spiralled out of control, which in turn only fueled the Mad King's paranoia.\n\nWhen [[Robert's Rebellion]] erupted, Tywin took no part. Only after it became clear that the rebels would be victorious, Tywin betrayed Aerys by sending his army to sack [[King's Landing]], delivering [[Robert Baratheon]] his final victory of the war. This action spawned the original friction between House Lannister and Ned Stark, who correctly observed that the Lannisters only intervened when it was convenient, and that they could not be trusted. Further, Ned was disgusted that the Lannister army had dishonorably sacked the city and even killed Rhaegar Targaryen's small children (as Aemon recounts to Jon in the TV series). The first book explains that [[Gregor Clegane]] led the Lannister forces that found and killed the children; Gregor personally killed Rhaegar's infant son by bashing his head in, then - while covered in the blood and brains of her baby - raped and killed Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell. Tywin's defense when confronted by Ned was that he never personally ordered Gregor to kill the royal children, but Tywin also did nothing to punish Gregor. It is Ned's disgust at Tywin's actions during the Sack of King's Landing that drive how he deals with Cersei's betrayal, because even if Cersei's children are bastards borne of incest, Ned knows that Robert would have all three killed if he told him, and Ned fears that this would make himself no better than Tywin.\n\nTywin pledged fealty to Robert in the aftermath of the conflict, and Robert agreed to marry Tywin's daughter Cersei. Tywin is proud of his son Jaime, a great warrior, but loathes his youngest son Tyrion, blaming him for the death of Tywin's wife, Joanna, in childbirth. The books make it clear that Tywin is unaware of the incestuous relationship between Jaime and Cersei.\n\nTywin's actual position on female members of his family taking part in political decisions is somewhat ambiguous in the books - particularly because Tywin's behavior is noted within the narrative for being hypocritical and at times contradictory. He does act like a very conservative and patrician male head of his household, but other characters remark that his love for his late wife Joanna was so great that she was actually his closest advisor. In her adult life, Tywin seems to have shunned Cersei from politics, but this was not always the case. The books state that Tywin actually doted on Cersei when she was a little girl, and even shared his plans with her in secret. All of this changed as Cersei grew older, however, when Tywin forced her into a loveless marriage to Robert Baratheon to secure a political alliance. Cersei felt betrayed that the father who once included her in his strategies now used her only as a tool, and increasingly blamed it on the secondary status of women in Westeros society. As in the TV series, however, it seems that as Cersei grew older Tywin correctly realized that she simply wasn't very intelligent or skilled at politics, so he eventually stopped wasting the time and effort of trying to train her at all.\n\nHis appearance is slightly different in the books, where he is completely bald with long golden &quot;side whiskers&quot; and green eyes flecked with gold.\n\nTywin's death is also slightly different in the books. After being told by Jaime the truth that Tysha, the whore he married when he was young, was not actually a whore and genuinely loved him, Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0took a long ladder up to a secret passage into Tywin's chambers, where, like in the TV series, he found and murdered Shae. Rather than confronting his father about Shae and the way in which he sentenced him to die for a crime he didn't commit, however,\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0confronted Tywin about Tysha\u00c2\u00a0while his father was seated on the privy. After inquiring about what happened to her,\u00c2\u00a0Tywin\u00c2\u00a0remained belligerent, continuing to\u00c2\u00a0refer to Tysha her as a whore, prompting\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion to shoot his father in the bowels after he called her a whore for a second time after being warned by Tyrion. At the moment of his death, Tywin's bowels loosened, causing Tyrion to lament that Lord Tywin Lannister did not in the end &quot;shit gold&quot;.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Tywin Lannister&quot; is pronounced &quot;TIE-win LAN-iss-ter&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Tih-win&quot;, etc.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|Lannisters don't act like fools.|'''Tywin Lannister'''|You Win or You Die}}\n{{Quote|A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.|'''Tywin Lannister'''|You Win or You Die}}\n{{Quote|Any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king.|'''Tywin Lannister'''|Mhysa}}\n{{Quote|Explain to me why it is more ''noble'' to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.|'''Tywin Lannister'''|Mhysa}}\n{{Dialogue a-b|Tywin Lannister|You are no son of mine.|Tyrion Lannister|I am your son.

Tywin marched with the full power of Casterly Rock to the capital, feigning that he had come to defend it from the rebellion. Aerys' advisors urged the King not to trust Tywin, even Jaime Lannister, who knew his father would never back the losing side in a war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kissed by Fire&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNevertheless, on Pycelle's advice, the gates were opened to the Lannister army.

Tywin is shocked when Amory dies on the threshold of his chambers but does not know who was responsible; he believes he was the one being targeted.

Arya serves him mutton, a meal he dislikes, Arya says she will go look for something else but he instead invites her to eat, and they talk about [[Harrenhal]] and how it came to ruin after Dragons attacked it. He is once again very impressed with her knowledge, and is amused by her will to defy him when he corrects her on how to refer to one's lord.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot;&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:War council.jpg|thumb|left|188px|Tywin hosts a war council at Harrenhal.]]\nRobb continues to win victories in the Westerlands, [[Battle of the Yellow Fork|taking]] captives at [[Yellow Fork]], forcing the [[Surrender of the Crag|surrender]] of [[the Crag]] and closing on [[Casterly Rock]] itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot;/&gt; King [[Stannis Baratheon]] sails on King's Landing.

Eventually Tywin relents and grants Tyrion an audience, who walks in on his father authoring a letter to an unknown individual in which Tywin describes [[the North]] as being &quot;ripe for the taking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;E21&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0requests his [[File:Tywin-Lannister.jpg|thumb|left|147px|Tywin acts as Hand of the King to Joffrey.]]father grant him\u00c2\u00a0[[Casterly Rock]], as he is his only heir since Jaime took his Kingsguard oath. Though Tywin\u00c2\u00a0promises that he will reward Tyrion for his efforts during the Battle of Blackwater, he says that he will never make Tyrion heir to\u00c2\u00a0Casterly Rock, considering him an abomination and a curse who killed his own mother and would humiliate the family name and turn Casterly Rock into a brothel. As Tyrion leaves, Tywin warns him that if he finds another whore in his chamber he will hang her.&lt;ref name=&quot;E21&quot;/&gt;\n\nTywin calls a Small Council meeting and has the meeting take place near his own chambers in the [[Tower of the Hand]] to assert his dominance. Tywin begins by chiding his fellow council members on their lack of progress to locating Jaime. Varys next informs Lord Tywin that Hoster Tully is dead and most of Robb Starks' forces are in Riverrun for his funeral. Roose Bolton has been left in charge of Harrenhal making him the de facto lord of the castle. Tywin argues that Baelish being lord of Harrenhal in name only serves his purposes just fine: courting Lysa Arryn. Tyrion brings up that this would leave the council without a Master Of Coin and Tywin agrees with his son for once and promptly names Tyrion the new Master Of Coin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTywin is later visited by Cersei in the Tower of the Hand. Cersei wants reassurance that all that can be done to locate her brother is being done. Tywin coldly states that if he went above and beyond to free Tyrion then it can be assumed that he would do even more to for his eldest son and heir. Cersei complains that he has [[File:Tywin lannister S3 promo.jpg|thumb|164px|Tywin takes up residence in the Tower of the Hand.]]always overlooked her in favor of her brothers despite heeding her father's advice and that she can contribute to the Lannister legacy. Tywin criticizes her for failing to rein in Joffrey's excesses and dryly states that he will succeed in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTywin summons Cersei and Tyrion for a meeting. Cersei has stumbled upon a Tyrell plot to wed [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] to Sansa, who Tywin now deems the key to [[Winterfell]] as Robb's army is disintegrating and his younger brothers are presumed dead. Thus the marriage would give the North to the Tyrells. Irked by their attempt to undermine him after he brought them into the royal family, Tywin counters with a scheme of his own. Instead, Sansa will marry Tyrion. Tyrion tries in vain to dissuade his father, but Tywin will not be swayed, noting that Sansa and Winterfell are a greater reward for his efforts during the [[Battle of Blackwater]] than Tyrion could have hoped for. Besides, he says, it is time Tyrion was married. Tyrion retorts that he was [[Tysha|once]]. Cersei's joy at Tyrion's discomfort is short-lived, as Tywin then decrees that she will marry Loras instead. Thus, his children will bind the Reach and the North to the Lannisters. He ignores her protests too, and laments that his children have disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kissed by Fire&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[File:TyOlennaTOTH.png|thumb|left|Tywin meets with Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]].]]Tywin meets with [[Olenna Tyrell]] to discuss his marriage pact. Lady Olenna is not enthusiastic about the marriage, deeming Cersei too old to wed the heir to [[Highgarden]]. Tywin attempts to force Olenna's hand by mentioning Loras' homosexuality. Olenna bluntly acknowledges that Loras is a &quot;sword swallower&quot;, but counters with a barb about the rumored incest between Jaime and Cersei. Tywin claims that this is a vile rumor spread by their foes, but even if it were true then House Tyrell has already bound itself to the Lannister side. When Lady Olenna still won't relent Tywin threatens to appoint Loras to the Kingsguard, where his vows would mean that the Tyrells' last male heir would be unable to marry or inherit Highgarden.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Climb]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After this compelling argument Lady Olenna\u00c2\u00a0graciously admits that Tywin has bested her, and accepts the marriage proposal.\nTywin is summoned to the throne room by Joffrey, who wants an update on small council business and demands to know why its meetings are now held in the [[Tower of the Hand]]. Tywin replies that the location is merely one of convenience, and informs Joffrey that he can attend small council meetings in person. Joffrey complains that this would entail climbing a lot of steps, He squirms as his grandfather approaches the throne and icily advises the King that, should he wish, it can be arranged for him to be carried up. Joffrey changes[[File:Bear maiden fair joff tywin.jpg|thumb|Tywin confronts Joffrey in the Throne Room.]] the subject to [[Daenerys Targaryen]], surprising his grandfather by showing that he is even aware of her. Tywin is dismissive, pointing out that the last dragon died centuries ago, and that even if the rumors are true, Daenerys is on the far side of the world and no threat. He urges Joffrey to heed the advice of his counsellors on matters he does not understand. With a smirk, he reassures his grandson that he will advise him when he deems it necessary.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTywin attends his son's wedding and he is not amused when Joffrey pulls a nasty prank on Tyrion. When others present also begin to snigger, Tywin quiets them with his standard icy glare. At the wedding feast Tywin chastises Tyrion for his drunkenness and tries to impart on his son the importance of putting a Lannister child in Sansa's womb. As the celebration is winding down Joffrey insists on starting the bedding ceremony to humiliate his uncle further. this leads to a very public and embarrassing row between the King and the Master Of Coin. Tywin swiftly defuses the situation and glances at the Tyrell table, where Olenna is quietly smirking at her opponent's frustration.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tywin Joff and Cersei Mhysa.png|thumb|left|Tywin holds a Small Council meeting.]]At a Small Council Meeting, Tywin reports word from [[Walder Frey|Lord Frey]] of the deaths of Robb and Catelyn Stark at the [[Red Wedding]] and of the annihilation of the remainder of the Northern army. Tyrion and Joffrey clash over the latter's intention to serve Robb's head to Sansa. When Tywin intervenes, Joffrey rashly accuses his grandfather of cowardice during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. An awkward silence follows before Tywin calmly orders for Joffrey to be taken to bed, despite the King's protests, and instructs Pycelle to sedate him. Once Tywin and Tyrion are alone in the chamber Tyrion dryly remarks that Tywin sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without supper. Tywin retorts &quot;you're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;S3E10&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe conversation returns to the massacre of the Starks, and Tyrion correctly deduces that Tywin orchestrated it, which his father confirms, adding that Walder Frey was given &quot;assurances&quot; by him in return for carrying it out. Tyrion shrewdly observes that this means the Freys will get all the credit, but also all the blame. Tywin senses that his son finds the action dishonorable but insists it was done to protect the family and end the war. He also reminds Tyrion of his duty to impregnate Sansa because that child will gain them [[the North]], explaining that a man who puts family first will always triumph. When Tyrion questions whether his father has ever put the family's interests ahead of his own, Tywin says he did just that when Tyrion was born: he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea but instead let him live and raised him as his son, because he was a Lannister.&lt;ref name=&quot;S3E10&quot;/&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nWith his family victorious over the Starks, Tywin\u00c2\u00a0has the Stark ancestral greatsword,\u00c2\u00a0[[Ice]], melted down and[[File:Tywinjaimenewsword.png|thumb|Tywin presents Oathkeeper to Jaime.]] reforged into [[Oathkeeper (sword)|two]] [[Widow's Wail|smaller]] longswords, while he personally burns down the wolf pelt scabbard of Ned Stark's sword.

He is later greeted by\u00c2\u00a0[[Oberyn Martell]]\u00c2\u00a0and his paramour,\u00c2\u00a0[[Ellaria Sand]]. The conversation is filled with veiled threats between Oberyn and Tywin, and he reminds him that his granddaughter,\u00c2\u00a0[[Myrcella]], is in Dorne, possibly hinting that he is planning to use her as a hostage against the Lannisters. When Joffrey\u00c2\u00a0is poisoned, Tywin\u00c2\u00a0covers Tommen's eyes to spare him from witnessing his brother's gruesome death. Along with everyone else present, he looks at [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] after the nearly dead king points accusingly at him. Even though many are shocked at the sight of the boy-king's sudden death, Tywin seems indiffrent upon witnessing the scene.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhile Tommen is paying his respects to Joffrey alongside his mother, Tywin strolls into the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] and begins to discuss kingship with his grandson. Tommen realizes\u00c2\u00a0 that he is the next king but doesn't know what kind of ruler he will be. Tywin and Tommen discuss previous kings and their failing at length over Joffrey's corpse, ignoring (in Tywin's case) Cersei's angry glares. To Tywin's delight, Tommen gets to the point of the conversation \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; a king must be ''wise'' \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; relatively quickly. Tywin tells Tommen that a wise king listens to his advisors, even after he is old enough to have some wisdom himself.\n\nTywin then walks Tommen out of the Sept, already prepping him on the duties of marriage. Later on, Tywin [[File:TyOb.png|thumb|Tywin enlists Oberyn Martell as a judge for Tyrion's trial.]]walks in on Oberyn Martell's orgy with some of Littlefinger's whores and asks for a private audience. After briefly discussing Oberyn's experience studying poisons at the Citadel, the Hand asks Oberyn to be the third judge at Tyrion's trial. Oberyn initially refuses, confirming that he blames Tywin for Elia's death, but he reconsiders when Tywin offers Oberyn in particular and Dorne in general a seat on the [[Small Council]]. Tywin explains that he wants to reunify the realms because he knows that one day, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] will turn her eyes to Westeros and seek to reclaim her family's throne, and the [[War of Conquest|last time]] dragons assaulted Westeros, only Dorne stood against them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTywin is of course present during his grandson Tommen's coronation, he chants, &quot;Long may he reign&quot; along with everybody else, albeit rather unconvincingly. Later that day, Tywin and Cersei are discussing House Lannister's future. They both agree that after an appropriate mourning period Tommen must wed Margaery and that Cersei should marry Loras shortly thereafter to ensure House Tyrell's continued support. Tywin [[File:TyTomm.png|thumb|left|Tywin educates his grandson Tommen on ruling.]]knows Cersei doesn't trust the Tyrells just as he disliked and mistrusted Robert who was too familiar with him. However, because wars are costly, House Tyrell's gold is needed to ease the financial burden. Tywin then admits the truth: House Lannister is broke, the goldmines of the Westerlands were exhausted long before the War of the Five Kings. The crown has been borrowing excessively from the Iron Bank Of Braavos. When Cersei suggests attempting to appease them somehow Tywin explains that there is no bargaining with the bank; you pay up or suffer the consequences, which is where the Tyrells come in. Cersei understands that it's all about the future and legacy of their house and asserts again that her brothers have caused nothing but problems in this respect. Jaime by refusing to follow Tywin's orders and Tyrion by killing Joffrey. Tywin is understanding of Cersei's ill will towards Tyrion, but refuses to discuss the trial with her.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBecause of his son's trial that afternoon Tywin is forced to hold a rushed Small Council meeting. All present pay their respects to him except Oberyn Martell. Varys informs Tywin that [[Sandor Clegane]] was spotted in the Riverlands and killed five of the King's men. Tywin substantially increases the bounty on Clegane, hoping to tempt men to risk tackling him. Next item, Daenaerys Targaryen's quick assent to power. With three growing dragons, a formidible standing army and two experienced knights to advise her, she is fast becoming a problem. Varys adds that it appears Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] has stopped spying on her for them, and is now loyal to her cause. Tywin chides Cersei for allowing Joffrey to humiliate and dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy. Tywin opts for subterfuge instead of a direct attack and commands Mace Tyrell to fetch him quill and paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Laws of Gods and Men&quot;/&gt;\n\nTommen recuses himself from [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister|his uncle's murder trial]] and appoints Tywin to preside in his stead, in [[File:Tywin Lannister in The Laws of Gods and Men.png|thumb|132px|Tywin presides over his son's trial.]]conjunction with Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn. The prosecution calls several witnesses against Tyrion who do an excellent job of painting him as a vengeful monster who wanted to kill Joffrey, albeit nearly all the testimony is exaggerated and circumstantial. Tyrion protests and is quickly silenced by Tywin. During recess, Jaime approaches his father. He offers to once again break his oath and take Tywin's seat at Casterly Rock, and in return Tyrion will be granted mercy and exiled to the [[Wall]] with the [[Night's Watch]]. After Jaime has left, Tywin's expression betrays that this is the outcome he longed for. When the trial resumes, the prosecution calls its last witness, who turns out to be Shae, much to Tyrion's horror. Seeing her humiliate and lie about him causes Tyrion to snap, cursing the crowd and raging that he is on trial not for regicide, but for being a dwarf. Tywin attempts to silence him but Tyrion, adamant that he will get no justice in court, demands a trial by combat, stunning Tywin into silence.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Laws of Gods and Men&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe day of his son's [[Second Trial by Combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]], Tywin is helping himself to some wine in the pulvinus above the arena. Pycelle delivers a rather longwinded speech before the fight commences, during which Tywin eyes Tyrion nervously and then abruptly cuts the Grand Maester off. Oberyn Martell has Gregor Clegane on his back and demands to know who ordered his sister's rape and murder and the death of her children, pointing at Tywin. The crowd then watches in horror as the mortally wounded Gregor suddenly grabs the Red Viper and, after loudly confessing his crimes, literally crushes him to a pulp. After the shrieks of horror and disgust have abated, Tywin sentences his son to death.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNow that Tyrion is about to die, Cersei tries to back out of wedding Loras. Tywin refuses and threatens to drag his daughter kicking and screaming to the Sept of Baelor if needs be. Cersei then plays her trump card; she admits to sleeping with Jaime and that all her children are incestuous bastards. Tywin feigns ingnorance, but Cersei sees through it. She knows Tywin wants her out of the way so he and Margaery can control Tommen. Cersei threatens to tell the world of her incestuous relationship, which would destroy her father's precious legacy. She then departs, leaving Tywin speechless.\n\n[[File:Tyrionfindtywinprivey.png|thumb|left|194px|Tywin in his final moments]]\nOn the eve of his execution Tyrion is surreptitiously released from his cell by his brother. He heads to his father's chambers and is shocked to find Shae in Tywin's bed. After strangling her, he takes Joffrey's crossbow and finds his father in his privy. Pointing the crossbow at him, Tyrion makes Tywin admit that he always wanted him dead, though Tywin insists that he grudgingly admired his resilience. He adds that he would never have allowed Tyrion to be executed, being his son, and was still intending to send him to the Wall. Tyrion whispers that he loved Shae, whom Tywin dismisses as a &quot;whore&quot;. Tyrion warns him not to use that word again, though Tywin voices his confidence that Tyrion will not harm him. He tearfully asks why Tywin sentenced his own son to death, when he knew that he did not kill Joffrey. When Tywin calls Shae a whore again, it is the final straw, and Tyrion shoots him in the stomach. Stunned and shocked, Tywin hisses &quot;you're no son of mine&quot;. Tyrion replies that he is, and always has been, his son. He shoots his father in the heart, killing him. His body is found shortly thereafter, and the bells of King's Landing are tolled.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Children]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Personality": "Tywin is known for his stoic, extremely intelligent, and calculating demeanor, but also his cold, manipulative, and often unfettered attitude, even for his family. The only person he held any sentiment towards was his late wife Joanna (whom he loved dearly), having died giving birth to their son Tyrion. Since then he expressed disdain towards Tyrion for the death of his wife, as well as for shaming Tywin and their family by being born a misshapen dwarf.\n\nTywin insists that all he does is for the sake of his family. Tywin's own father Tytos was a generous and caring man, whose bad investments and indecision made House Lannister a laughingstock. Tywin had to rebuild his family's fortunes almost singlehandedly, and sees outward signs of caring and emotion as the same kind of weakness that his own father showed. Ironically, however, Tywin's harsh actions and unwillingness to serve as a caring father figure have resulted in severe emotional problems in all three of his children, who are all terrified of him. Jaime and Cersei have been having an incestuous sexual relationship since they were very young, partially due to the lack of any loving parental relationship either of them had. Tywin actually spent most of their lives away in King's Landing serving as Hand of the King, and with their mother dead, his children were functionally raised by servants. Tywin only sporadically visited his home at Casterly Rock, and on the occasions when he did return he would deal out severe punishment for any transgressions his children committed while he was away.\n\nWhat little relationship Tywin may have had with Tyrion was destroyed when Tywin had his marriage to the commoner [[Tysha]] annulled, then forced Tyrion to watch as he had his guards gang-rape the girl. Tywin wanted to force all of his children into marriage-alliances to benefit House Lannister (as Cersei was later married off to King Robert), and he was offended that Tyrion risked such a future marriage alliance for himself by marrying a commoner for love. The hypocrisy in this is that Tywin ''himself'' married for love when he married his own first cousin Joanna, instead of entering into a marriage-alliance with another more powerful noble family. Over the years, Tywin seemed to develop an outright joy in inflicting petty humiliations on Tyrion, such as &quot;rewarding&quot; him on his sixteenth [[nameday]] by putting him in charge of the privys and sewers at Casterly Rock. Yet despite all this, Tywin is blind to the fact that Tyrion is the most intelligent and politically cunning of all of his children.\n\nMeanwhile, Tywin possesses a very conservative, patrician set of social values, in which women are suited to securing marriage-alliances and little else, not wielding power on their own. Thus in contrast to [[House Tyrell]], in which female members of the family are trained in ruling and court intrigue as much as the men are, Tywin never trained Cersei how to rule. Without instruction from her father, because Tywin always disregarded her as simply a means to an end, Cersei turned into a queen who actually isn't very skilled at the art of ruling.\n\nOf his three children Tywin has the least shame for Jaime, but not outright respect. Tywin feels disappointed that Jaime wants to continue to be a member of the Kingsguard, as while it is the highest honor a knight can aspire to, it means that Jaime had to swear away his rights to marriage or inheritance, which would leave Tywin's hated son Tyrion as his heir.\n\nTywin does have a generally good relationship with his younger brother Kevan, whom he shaped his whole life to serve as his faithful lieutenant. On the whole, however, for a man who claims to value family above all else, Tywin has hypocritically destroyed his relationships with his own children.\n\nTywin lacks, or at least overtly lacks, the sadistic and bloodthirsty nature of his grandson Joffrey. Tywin is intelligent enough to weigh political reality against a desire for personal, petty revenge. When Tywin arrived at Lannister-occupied [[Harrenhal]], he put a stop to the pointless torture of captured smallfolk, simply because it would be a more efficient use of resources to put them to work. In contrast, during the [[Sack of King's Landing]] he allowed his army to pillage and rape throughout the city, devastating its inhabitants. Underneath his calm exterior, Tywin can be seen to take personal satisfaction in crushing his enemies, and particularly in inflicting petty humiliations on his son Tyrion. Tywin treated his plans for the Red Wedding as a necessity of war, and he had the Stark family sword,\u00c2\u00a0[[Ice]], melted down because it was made out of irreplaceable [[Valyrian steel]] which could be used to make other weapons. Privately, however, he bore a look of satisfaction as he personally threw Ice's wolf-pelt scabbard into a fire.\n\nDespite his ruthless and calculating nature, Tywin is shown to have a good side if he is impressed with someone, demonstrated when he treats his young cupbearer (unaware that she is Arya Stark) with respect and kindness when she displays knowledge and the ability to read, speaks openly with her and even allows her to eat his dinner when he is not hungry and treat herself to whatever she likes in the kitchen. He also demonstrates this side with his grandson Tommen, whom he knows will become a much better and wiser king than Joffrey, and shares his knowledge and wisdom concerning the duties of a king.\n\n"}, "title": "Tywin Lannister"}
