I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the [[Iron Throne]].|[[Thoros of Myr]]|And Now His Watch is Ended}}\n'''House Clegane''' is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. Their lands are southeast of Casterly Rock and consist of a small patch of land and a modest house. They are landed [[knights]] rather than a full [[noble house]], but have strong ties to the Lannisters.\n\nThe current head of the family is Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], known as &quot;The Mountain That Rides&quot;. Gregor has a younger brother, [[Sandor Clegane]], known as &quot;The Hound&quot;.\n\nThe Clegane sigil is three black dogs on a dark yellow background. The three dogs signify the three dogs that died fighting off the lioness that attacked Tytos Lannister.&lt;ref&gt;[[Complete Guide to Westeros]] - House Clegane]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "In the books": "In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', the kennelmaster lost three hounds and a leg in the process of saving Lord Tytos. As a reward, Lord Tytos gave him lands and a towerhouse and took his son as his squire. Their sigil is three dogs on a yellow field; the three dogs represent the dogs that died saving Lord Tytos. [[Thoros]] commented that in view of the atrocities performed by the Cleganes, an image of [[Aegon Targaryen (Son of Rhaegar)|two]] [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|bloody infants]] would have been more suitable for their house sigil.\n\nClegane's grandson, Gregor, became notable for his extreme size, and the rumor that he burned his younger brother's face as a child for playing with a toy without asking him. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Gregor Clegane proved his worth and ferocity in battle for Lord Tywin Lannister, who took note of him and made him one of his inner council of battle leaders, noting that he was the most feared man in the realm.\n\nGregor's father, his younger sister, and his first two wives all died under unusual circumstances, leaving him and Sandor as the last members of the house.\n\nAccording to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, &quot;Clegane&quot; is pronounced &quot;Cli-GAIN&quot;, as opposed to &quot;CLEG-ain&quot;, etc.\n\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nHouse Clegane tourney.jpg|The banner of House Clegane at the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]] in &quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;.\nMountainHorse.jpg|Ser Gregor's stallion covered with cloak displaying the sigil of House Clegane\nHouse Clegane shield.jpg|A shield emblazoned with the sigil of House Clegane (left) on display at the Tourney of the Hand in &quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;.\nHouse Clegane.png|HBO viewer's guide icon for House Clegane.\nClegane-small.png|Small icon of House Clegane from the HBO viewers guide.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Members": "* The {[[First Clegane]]}, kennelmaster at [[Casterly Rock]], raised to knighthood after saving Lord Tytos' life.\n** {His son}, father of Gregor and Sandor.
