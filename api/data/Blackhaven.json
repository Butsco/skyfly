According to legend, the castle was granted by the Storm King to a loyal scout who avoided Dornish patrols to bring him warning of an impending attack. At one point the scout was ambushed, but his attackers were killed in a freak lightning strike. As a result, the scout, who was the founder of House Dondarrion, adopted a lightning bolt as his symbol.\n\nBlackhaven is the home of Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]].\n\n"}, "title": "Blackhaven"}
