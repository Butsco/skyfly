As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag, he tells his elder son, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], that this conflict will decide the fate of their family; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist, as the Targaryens had done. He orders Jaime to become the man he was meant to be, and to take thirty thousand men and besiege [[Riverrun]], Catelyn's childhood home and the seat of [[House Tully]]. Jaime ponders why Tywin would risk so much for the ugly, stunted son that he hates, but to Tywin a Lannister is a Lannister - even though he considers Tyrion the least worthy member of their family, any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak.\n\n[[Image:Eddard and Cersei 1x07.png|right|200px|thumb|Eddard Stark confronts Cersei Lannister with his findings.]]\nIn [[King's Landing]], Lord [[Eddard Stark]] meets with [[Cersei Lannister]]. He tells her that he knows the secret that [[Jon Arryn]] died for: that Cersei's three children are not [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s, but the product of [[incest]] between her and Jaime. Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it, comparing their love to the old [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] practice of marrying brother to sister; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night, when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei's bed and called her ''&quot;[[Lyanna]]&quot;''. Eddard angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately. When Robert returns from his hunt, he will tell him the truth of the matter and Cersei should run as far as she can before that happens, lest Robert's wrath find her. Cersei icily calls Ned a fool for turning down the throne himself after the sack of King's Landing. Eddard tells her that he has regrets, but that isn't one of them. Cersei departs with a chilling warning: &quot;When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.&quot;\n\nIn one of his brothels, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] instructs the newly-arrived [[Ros]] and another prostitute, [[Armeca]], on how to please their customers and make them happy. When they ask him to join them, he refuses, saying that he only ever had eyes for one woman. He tells them about his past, how he loved and fought a duel for a [[Catelyn Stark|woman]]. He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means, as they would never let him compete on equal terms. When Ros asks him what he wants, he says, &quot;Oh, everything.&quot;        \n[[Image:Theon and Osha.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Theon attempts to intimidate Osha.]]\nIn [[Winterfell]], [[Theon Greyjoy]] attempts to bully [[Osha]], the [[Free Folk|wildling]] woman captured in the recent raid. He insists that she refer to him as &quot;My Lord&quot;, but she is unimpressed with his antics. She points out that he is not entitled to this, as his father is still alive. [[Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] dismisses Theon and questions Osha about why her band crossed [[The Wall|the Wall]] and were fleeing &quot;as far south as south goes&quot;. She claims that the [[White Walkers]] have awoken after millennia asleep and are coming south, to Luwin's skepticism.\n\nAt [[the Wall]], [[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] are standing watch when [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]]'s horse is spotted returning, but there is no sign of Benjen himself.        \n[[Image:Robert's last act.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Robert Baratheon signs a document confirming Eddard Stark as Protector of the Realm.]]\nAt King's Landing, [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] finds Eddard and tells him that Robert has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive. Eddard finds Robert telling [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] that he wishes he could have been a better father to him. Eddard chooses not to tell Robert about his discoveries to spare his final hours from pain. Robert instructs Eddard to take a letter naming him as the Lord Protector of the Realm, to rule until Joffrey comes of age. Eddard does not write Joffrey's name, instead saying &quot;the rightful heir&quot;. Robert also asks him to cancel the attempt on [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s life. Leaving the chamber, Eddard talks to [[Varys]], who slyly points out that [[Lancel Lannister]] ensured the King kept &quot;refreshed&quot; with alcohol during the hunt, meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable. Varys also says it is far too late to stop the attempt on Daenerys' life.        \n[[Image:Drogo and Dany.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Daenerys tries to convince Drogo to invade Westeros.]]\n\nIn [[Vaes Dothrak]], Daenerys attempts to convince [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] about the benefits of an invasion of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], but Drogo is reluctant to cross the [[Narrow Sea]], despite the thousands of [[ships]] they could find in the [[Free Cities]] to do the job. He says that a man doesn't need an &quot;[[Iron Throne|iron chair]]&quot; but only a [[Horses|horse]]. Daenerys travels to the marketplace with Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] and her handmaidens. She asks Jorah to help convince her husband since the [[Seven Kingdoms]] are hers by birthright but he reminds her that her ancestor [[Aegon the Conqueror]] took six of the Seven Kingdoms, because he was capable of doing so (due to his [[dragons]]), nothing more. Jorah is delivered a message from Varys, a royal pardon for his crimes; he quickly realizes that this would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy. Seeing Daenerys with a [[wineseller]] who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from [[the Arbor]], Jorah realizes that the wine has been poisoned; this is the assassination attempt. Having second thoughts, he steps in and stops Daenerys from drinking it. The wineseller attempts to flee, but [[Rakharo]] brings him down with a\u00c2\u00a0bolo tangling his ankles.\n\n[[Image:Wineseller captured.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The wineseller is captured after trying to poison Daenerys.]]\nAt [[Castle Black]], Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] names the trainees as men of the [[Night's Watch]]. He hands out assignments, but to Jon's disgust he is being sent to the [[Steward (Night's Watch)|stewards]], not the [[Ranger|rangers]]. He will work directly for the Lord Commander as his personal steward. His attempts to plead his case to Maester [[Aemon]] (who has selected Samwell as his own steward) are met with indifference. However, Sam suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] to punish Jon, it is also an opportunity for the Lord Commander to groom Jon directly for command. Both are then surprised when [[Pypar]]\u00c2\u00a0admits that he was sent to the Watch for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord, not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed. Nothing about being sent to the Wall is fair.      \n[[Image:Eddard's letter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The letter Eddard sends to Stannis Baratheon, informing him of his findings.]]\n\nAt King's Landing, Renly confronts Eddard and offers him a hundred swords to take the queen and her children into custody, but Eddard refuses to dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in the [[Red Keep]] and taking frightened children hostage. Renly suggests that he could make a good king, but Eddard angrily points out that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] is Renly's older brother and the true heir. In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to Lord Stannis and instructs a [[Tomard|courier]] to take the message to [[Dragonstone]], Stannis's island fortress. Littlefinger then arrives and talks to Eddard, who tells him the truth about Joffrey's parentage. Littlefinger suggests that they keep quiet, acknowledge Joffrey as king and make him their puppet. If he proves intractable, they can reveal the truth and crown the more malleable Renly instead. Eddard considers this treason. Littlefinger realizes that even though Lord Eddard has Robert's edict naming him [[Regent]] and [[Protector of the Realm]], he doesn't have the men he needs to seize control from Cersei. He needs the loyalty of the [[City Watch]]. Littlefinger understands that the honorable Eddard Stark can't come right out and ask him to bribe them, but agrees to do what needs to be done.\n\n[[Image:Jon and Sam oaths.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly swear their oaths to the Night's Watch.]]\nUp north, Jon and Sam say their oath of fealty to the Night's Watch in front of a [[heart tree]] just inside the eaves of the [[Haunted Forest]] and are acknowledged as men of the Watch. Sam decided to take the oath with Jon to the [[Old Gods of the Forest]], as [[Faith of the Seven|the Seven]] gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him. After they take their oaths, [[Ghost]] finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to Jon and a horrified Sam.\n\nWith the wine seller captured,\u00c2\u00a0Ser\u00c2\u00a0Jorah tells\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0that Robert\u00c2\u00a0Baratheon\u00c2\u00a0will never stop trying to kill her and her future children.\u00c2\u00a0Drogo\u00c2\u00a0quickly arrives in the tent. He glares at the seller and then goes to\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0to ensure she is okay, before offering\u00c2\u00a0Jorah\u00c2\u00a0the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination. Angered, he begins to yell out in\u00c2\u00a0[[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]]\u00c2\u00a0that his army will cross the &quot;[[Narrow Sea|poison water]]&quot; as no\u00c2\u00a0khalasar\u00c2\u00a0has done before and take the Iron Throne for\u00c2\u00a0[[Rhaego|his son]].\u00c2\u00a0Drogo's\u00c2\u00a0khalasar departs\u00c2\u00a0[[Vaes Dothrak]]\u00c2\u00a0the next morning, with the wine seller tied naked to the saddle of\u00c2\u00a0Daenerys'\u00c2\u00a0horse, forced to walk\u00c2\u00a0until he eventually falls of exhaustion and is dragged to his death.\n\n[[File:Ned 1x07.png|right|210px|thumb|Eddard Stark confronts King Joffrey in the throne room.]]\nIn King's Landing, Eddard is summoned to the throne room by &quot;King Joffrey&quot;; Robert has died. He arrives to find Littlefinger and Varys waiting for him, along with Commander [[Janos Slynt]] and a detachment of the City Watch. Varys tells him that Renly has fled the city, along with Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] and a number of retainers. They were last seen heading south. The party enters the throne room, where Joffrey sits on the [[Iron Throne]]. He demands oaths of fealty from his councilors and subjects. Instead, Eddard gives Ser Barristan Selmy the proclamation naming him as Lord Protector of the Realm. To Barristan's shock, Cersei takes the &quot;paper shield&quot; and tears it up. Instead, she suggests that Eddard bend the knee and swear allegiance. In return he will be allowed to return to Winterfell. Eddard responds that Joffrey has no claim to the Iron Throne and commands Slynt to take the Queen and her son into custody. Instead, the City Watch kill Eddard's bodyguards and Littlefinger holds a knife to his throat, saying, &quot;I did warn you not to trust me.&quot;\n\n", "Notes": "* The episode takes its name from Cersei's phrase &quot;When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die&quot;.\n* The revelation that Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen are not Robert's children means that Robert's younger brother, [[Stannis Baratheon]], is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Stannis appears in the [[Season 2|second season]].\n* The establishing shots of the Lannister camp, at 3:28, show [[Timett]] and [[Chella]] in error. The footage was taken from scenes shot for the next episode, &quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;.\n* The stag shown being skinned by Charles Dance (as Tywin Lannister) was real. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (as Jaime Lannister) enjoys venison, and he hoped that, after the scene, the stag could be sent to Craft Services, but that didn't happen. The books never portray Tywin Lannister skinning a stag. The books do introduce another character this way&amp;mdash;Lord [[Randyll Tarly]], Samwell Tarly's father, who is doing this in ''A Game of Thrones'' during a flashback in which Sam tells Jon Snow about how his father made him join the Night's Watch. Randyll Tarly had yet to be cast when this scene was filmed, so the show's writers gave this introduction to Tywin Lannister.\n* To date, this is one of only four episodes in which\u00c2\u00a0[[Tyrion Lannister]] has not appeared. The other three are &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;, &quot;[[First of His Name]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Watchers on the Wall]]&quot;.\n* In the book, Eddard does not send Stannis a letter telling him that he is the rightful heir. The letter is written, but intercepted. Stannis already suspected that the children were not Robert's, as he was investigating it with Jon Arryn. Since Arryn's death, Stannis has been building his forces on Dragonstone.\n* Lord Baelish never could support Stannis's claim to the throne. Stannis has despised Littlefinger ever since Littlefinger protected City Watch Commander [[Janos Slynt]] from prosecution and dismissal, after the discovered that Slynt was receiving bribes. Stannis is a strict adherent to law and order, and he has banned prostitution on Dragonstone, so Petyr Baelish's livelihood would end if Stannis came to power.\n*The scene between Tywin and Jaime, and the scene between Theon, Osha, and Maester Luwin, were written at the last minute because the rough cut of the episode was running short. Both scenes were filmed in post-production reshoots, and they contain only interior shots which didn't need to be filmed on location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&amp;A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "You Win or You Die"}
