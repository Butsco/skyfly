Neither Renly nor the any member of [[House Tyrell]] is the subject of mockery in the wedding feast.\n\nOn the contrary, the song ''Lord Renly's Ride'', by Hamish the Harper, depicts Renly as repenting from attempting to usurp Joffrey and defying the Lord of Death to return to the world of the living to fight for him on the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], and then returning to [[Highgarden]] to look once more at his beloved [[Margaery Tyrell]]. The song was inspired by the account of Renly's ghost fighting along the forces of [[House Tyrell]] and [[House Lannister]] - it was actually [[Garlan Tyrell]] wearing Renly's armor; in the show it was Loras himself.\n\nHamish the Harper also sings ''A Rose of Gold'' in honor of House Tyrell.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nA [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], he makes a living by performing for other peoples' amusement.\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nAlong with a group of other dwarfs, he takes part in a mock &quot;reenactment&quot; of the [[War of the Five Kings]] at [[Purple Wedding|King Joffrey's wedding]].
