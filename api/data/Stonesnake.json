He is short and wiry man, near fifty with a grey beard. He is stronger than he looks, and has the best night-eyes of anyone Jon has ever known. He's dubbed Stonesnake for his ability for climbing mountains and cliffs.\n\nStonesnake leads the mission to scale the [[Skirling Pass]] at night to ambush a trio of wildling watchers. He and Jon kill two of the sentries (one of them is [[Orell]]). He expresses distrust in [[Ygritte]] and later informs Qhorin of what she told Jon.\n\nIn the novels, his fate is uncertain. After his horse panics and breaks its leg, he offers to stay behind and fight the pursuing wildlings like Dalbridge, but Qhorin orders him to make it through the [[Frostfangs]] afoot to the [[Fist of the First Men|Fist]], and to tell [[Jeor Mormont|Mormont]] what they saw. Jon watches as\u00c2\u00a0Stonesnake goes away, and fears that he has no chance. Stonesnake has not been mentioned since. While it has not been confirmed that he died, according to the novels appendix he was lost afoot in the Skirling Pass.\n\n", "TOP": "Stonesnake07983d3q3a5vorzotdwve717iu2bibq7u4cq1760992015-03-10T03:40:58ZSharp Blades26158496{{Heraldry\n|image=Crow mini shield.png\n|link=Night's Watch\n}}\n{{Character\n| Title=Stonesnake\n| Image= Stonesnake2x06.jpg\n| Season=[[Season 2|2]]\n| First=&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;\n| Last=&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;\n| Appearances=2 episodes &lt;small&gt;([[#Appearances|see below]])&lt;/small&gt;\n| Aka= \n| Titles=Ranger\n| Status= [[:Category:Status: Dead|Deceased]]\n| Death=\n| Place=\n| Allegiance=The [[Night's Watch]]\n| Family=\n| Actor=}}\n\n'''Stonesnake''' is a recurring background character in the [[Season 2|second season]].
