Three mermen with tridents, something like that.|Stannis praises Davos.|The Prince of Winterfell}}\n'''House Seaworth''' is a [[noble house|vassal house]] that holds fealty to [[House Baratheon]] of [[Dragonstone]]. Their lands are located on Cape Wrath in the [[Stormlands]]. Their home is a small but cozy keep near the sea.\n\nHouse Seaworth is ruled by the landed [[knight]] Ser [[Davos Seaworth]], the so-called &quot;Onion Knight&quot;, a reformed smuggler in the service of Lord [[Stannis Baratheon]] at [[Dragonstone]]. His wife [[Marya Seaworth|Marya]] and their youngest sons are usually found at their keep.\n\nHouse Seaworth came into existence after [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Davos Seaworth, a smuggler infamous on the [[Narrow Sea]] for being able to smuggle anything anywhere, transported a cargo hold full of onions into the besieged castle of [[Storm's End]], keeping the garrison alive until the war was over. Stannis Baratheon rewarded Davos by [[knighthood|knighting]] him and giving him lands, though he also insisted on taking the tips of the fingers on Davos' right hand in compensation for his smuggling. Davos judged this fair, since it bought him and his family a more secure future, one he could never have imagined, much less earned for them on his own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/sbaratheon/davos-seaworth/  HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of Dragonstone, Davos Seaworth entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "References": "{{Reflist}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Davos Seaworth has seven sons: Dale, Allard, Matthos, Marc, Devan, Stannis, and Steffon.
