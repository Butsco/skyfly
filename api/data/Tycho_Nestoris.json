He has a gaunt face with a thin rope of a beard growing from his chin which hangs down to his waist. He wears expensive robes of a sober dark purple color, trimmed with ermine fur. He is not introduced until the fifth novel, ''A Dance with Dragons''.\n\nStannis does not personally travel to Braavos to meet with Tycho before sailing to the Wall. In the early novels the bank's\u00c2\u00a0communications with alternatively Stannis or the Lannisters are handled through written correspondence, and later Tycho Nestoris is sent to the Wall to negotiate with Stannis once he has reasserted himself as a major player by [[Battle of Castle Black#In the books|protecting]] the [[Wall]] from [[wildlings]], meeting with [[Jon Snow]] in the process. The TV producers, however, stated that they thought it was important to physically introduce Tycho earlier instead of later. One of [[Bryan Cogman]]'s initial ideas for &quot;The Laws of Gods and Men&quot; was to have Tycho come to Dragonstone to treat with Stannis, not the other way around: this was also changed to have Stannis visit Braavos, because they realized it was also important to physically introduce the city of Braavos and the Iron Bank itself as soon as possible. Cogman also felt that it made more dramatic sense for Stannis to have to come to Braavos to essentially beg for money, because at the moment he is losing the war, so logically the Iron Bank doesn't think he is significant enough anymore to go through the bother of sending an envoy to meet with him in person.  \nAs a result, Tycho's scenes in Season 4 have no direct counterpart in the third novel, though they are a condensation of running subplots involving the Iron Bank which are discussed at council meetings.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "*On the [[Season 4]] Blu-ray, Tycho narrates the [[Histories &amp; Lore]] videos on '''&quot;[[The Iron Bank of Braavos (Histories &amp; Lore)|The Iron Bank of Braavos]]&quot;'''.\n\n", "TOP": "Tycho Nestoris0196674o2vobh7xm7s7ian93iq9juc4eba8ig1803272015-03-29T19:59:25ZAsguardian26092854{{Heraldry\n|image=Iron Bank seal mini shield.png\n|link=Iron Bank of Braavos\n}}\n{{Character\n|Title =Tycho Nestoris\n|Image = Tycho promo.png\n|Season = [[Season 4|4]], [[Season 5|5]]\n|First = &quot;[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]&quot;\n|Last = \n|Appearances = \n|Status= [[:Category:Status: Alive|Alive]]\n|Place = [[Braavos]]\n|Titles = \n|Allegiance =[[Iron Bank of Braavos]]\n|Actor = [[Mark Gatiss]]}}\n{{Quote|Across the Narrow Sea your books are filled with words like 'usurper' and 'madman' and 'blood right'.
