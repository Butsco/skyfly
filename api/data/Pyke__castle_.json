The castle is the regional capital of the Iron Islands as a whole. Pyke is an ancient stronghold and the cliff it was built on has been eroded by the sea leaving the towers standing on stone stacks. The towers are connected by swaying rope bridges. The rocky moss covered stone at its base is not suitable for ships landing so traffic to the island flows through the nearby harbor town [[Lordsport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/pyke/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Pyke entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&quot;Pyke&quot; is also the name given to [[bastards]] born on the Iron Islands.\n\n", "Image Gallery": "[[Image:pykeopening.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Pyke]] as it appears in the title sequence.]]\n[[File:Pyke-loc.jpg|thumb|563x563px]]\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nPykecastle3.jpg\nKimberly Pope Pyke Concept Art VII.jpg\nKimberly Pope Pyke Concept Art VI.jpg\nKimberly Pope Pyke Concept Art V.jpg\nKimberly Pope Pyke Concept Art IV.jpg\nKimberly Pope Pyke Concept Art III.jpg\nKimberly Pope Pyke Concept Art II.jpg\nKimberly Pope Pyke Concept Art I.jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Notable residents of the castle": "* King [[Balon Greyjoy]], [[King of the Iron Islands]], [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].\n** Princess [[Yara Greyjoy]], his only daughter.\n* [[Victarion Greyjoy]], Balon's brother, Captain of the [[Iron Fleet]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Pyke is an ancient, storm-worn fortress built atop several rocky towers jutting out of the sea. It is connected to the main island by a treacherous-footed rope bridge, and defended by tall walls.\n\nPyke was long considered impregnable, but during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] immense siege-ships commanded by [[Stannis Baratheon]] smashed the walls down with boulders, allowing ground troops to [[Siege of Pyke|storm]] the castle. The onslaught was so severe that the first men through the breach, including [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]] and [[Jorah Mormont]], suffered relatively few losses and were able to secure a bridgehead within the walls.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF|Pyke}}\n\n"}, "title": "Pyke (castle)"}
