It is the seat of [[House Bolton]], located on the banks of the [[Weeping Water]] east of [[Winterfell]]. The Dreadfort is ill-omened as the stronghold of House Bolton, who are famed for the flayed skins of their enemies, often rumored to have been kept on display in the castle, including those of several ancient [[House Stark|Stark]] kings. However, if such gruesome trophies ever did exist they have long since been removed or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/dreadfort/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Dreadfort entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/dreadfort/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Dreadfort entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Dreadfort has a similar history of dissent and rebellion. Three centuries after the founding of [[Karhold]], the Starks finally crushed the Boltons in a war that saw the Dreadfort besieged for two years. The Dreadfort is built around volcanic vents, which heat the castle in a similar manner to the natural hot springs under Winterfell.\n\nThe Dreadfort is a strong fortress, with high walls and triangular merlons that look like sharp stone teeth. It has thick stone walls and massive towers. Its great hall is dim and smoky, with rows of torches grasped by skeletal human hands jutting from the walls. Long tables stand before a dais with a high table. The hall has a vaulted ceiling and wooden rafters turned black from smoke.\n\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "Myra Castle in [[Wikipedia:County Down, Northern Ireland|County Down, Northern Ireland]] serves as the exterior of the Dreadfort in the [[Season 4|fourth season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn7ArWFrBnc Game of Thrones Season 4: \u007fArtisan Piece #3 - Shooting in Belfast (HBO)]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nDreadfort-exterior-2.jpg\nDreadfort-interior-1.jpg\nDreadfort-exterior-3.jpg\nDreadfort-exterior-4.jpg\nDreadfort-kennels.jpg|The Dreatfort's kennels.\nDreadfort exterior.jpg|One of the Dreadfort's guard towers.\nDreadfort-opening-sequence.jpg|The Dreadfort as it appears in the opening titles.\nRamsay's chamber.png|Ramsay's bedchamber.\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Notable residents": "* Lord [[Roose Bolton]], [[Lord of the Dreadfort]] and [[Warden of the North]].\n**Lady [[Walda Bolton]], Roose's latest wife.
