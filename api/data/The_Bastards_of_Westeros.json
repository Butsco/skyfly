A simple word for a simple act. And so, of course, men complicate it. A child born to a wife is a gift from the gods. A child born to a mistress or an obedient servant girl is a [[Bastardy|bastard]], unworthy of its father's name. So instead they call the children after the land where they were born: &quot;Flowers&quot; in [[the Reach]] and &quot;Hill&quot; in [[the Westerlands]], &quot;Stone&quot; in [[The Vale of Arryn|the Vale]] and &quot;Storm&quot; in [[the Stormlands]], &quot;Rivers&quot; in [[the Riverlands]] and &quot;Waters&quot; in [[the Crownlands]], &quot;Pyke&quot; in the [[Iron Islands]], &quot;Snow&quot; in [[The North]] and in [[Dorne]], &quot;Sand&quot;.\n\nBy these names, everyone can recognise a bastard, even if his own father won't. Though sometimes a father with too much gold and daughters will ask the king to [[Legitimization|legitimize]] a bastard son and give him his family name. If his wife objects, the next one does not. But sometimes the gods play their jokes and later his wife will give him a trueborn son of their own. When this happens, well...children die all the time, so do fathers.\n\nEven the beautiful [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] had bastards when brothers tired of their sisters. Many took the name [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre]] after [[Aegon I Targaryen|the Conquerer]]'s own [[Blackfyre|sword]]. When [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]] legitimized all [[Daemon Blackfyre|his]] [[Aegor Rivers|bastards]] on his deathbed, they [[Blackfyre Rebellion|rose up]] against his [[Daeron II Targaryen|trueborn heir]]. Westeros bled, Dorne yawned.\n\nFor most of Westeros, the Blackfyre Rebellion only proved what they already knew: bastards are treacherous, born of lust and shame. But in Dorne lust is not shameful. They know that bastardy does not make a man more treacherous than another; man does not need the help. \n\n"}, "title": "The Bastards of Westeros"}
