She is a member of the ruling council of the Faith of the Seven, known as the Most Devout. Given that the Faith of the Seven is loosely based on the real-life medieval Catholic Church, the Most Devout is analogous to the College of Cardinals. While the Catholic Church has no female priests or cardinals, the Faith of the Seven does have female clergy, and several of the Most Devout are women at the time of the novels (besides Unella, other named women on the council are Aglantine, Helicent, and Moelle). Also unlike the Catholic Church, members of the Most Devout do not gain a new title (i.e. from &quot;Father&quot; to &quot;Bishop&quot; to &quot;Cardinal&quot;), so Unella's full title is simply &quot;Septa Unella&quot;, not &quot;Most Devout Unella&quot;. It hasn't been specified if there has ever been a female High Septon (High Septa), though there may have been.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\n===[[Season 5]]===\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Unella"}
