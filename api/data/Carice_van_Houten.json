Van Houten discussed her role in an interview with Cyril Falisse from the Ferryman Critical on February 22, 2012. She said &quot;I think I am only in episodes 1, 2, 4 and 10 or something. You are not going to see me that much but in season 3 that we are going to shoot this summer I'll come back with a vengeance.&quot; Regarding her role she said &quot;I'm [Stannis'] right hand. I manipulate him. I take the decisions for him almost. I wouldn't say I'm a very sympathetic character. I have a great wig, great red hair. I hope I did it right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://lepasseurcritique.blogspot.com/2012/02/interview-carice-van-houten.html&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Filmography": "*3 roden - Emily (1997)\n*Suzy Q - Suzy (1999)\n*AmnesiA - Sandra (2001)\n*Minoes - Minoes (2002)\n*Father's Affair - Monika (2003)\n*Bonkers - Lis (2005)\n*Black Book - Rachel Stein (2006)\n*Love Is All - Kiki Jollema (2007)\n*Valkyrie - Nina von Stauffenberg (2008)\n*Komt een vrouw bij de dokter - Carmen (2009)\n*De gelukkige huisvrouw - Lea (2010)\n*Repo Men - Carol (2010)\n*Black Death - Langiva (2010)\n*In therapie - Aya (2010)\n*Black Butterflies - Ingrid Jonker (2011)\n*Intruders - Susanna (2011)\n*Game of Thrones - [[Melisandre]] (2012-present)\n*Alles is familie - Winnie de Roover (2012)\n*Jackie - Sofie (2012)\n\n", "See also": "*{{WP}}\n*{{IMDb\n|# = 0396924}}\n*{{Twitter\n|# = caricevhouten}}\n*{{Instagram|# = leavecaricealone}}\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "*Carice van Houten was previously asked to audition for a different role when [[season 1]] was shot, but schedule conflicts prevented her from auditioning.
