It is one of the major cities of [[Westeros]], located where the [[White Knife]] River flows into [[the Bite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/Moat_Cailin/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Moat Cailin entry]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the seat of [[House Manderly]], a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. White Harbor is the main seaport of the North and is one of only five settlements in Westeros large enough to be called a city, though it is the smallest of the five (the other four being, in decreasing order of size: [[King's Landing]], [[Oldtown]], [[Lannisport]], and [[Gulltown]]).\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, White Harbor is the main center of trade and merchant activity in the North. Though the smallest of the major cities of Westeros, it is still far larger than any other settlement north of Gulltown and [[Braavos]].\n\nThe city's harbor is defended by an outer sea wall almost a mile long, with tall towers located every 100 feet along the wall. The mouth of the White Knife River is guarded by the Seal Rock, named for the animals that dot its flanks. The city itself contains an old, mostly-abandoned [[godswood]], with most religious worship taking place at the Snow Sept. The oldest building in the city is the old keep, the Wolf's Den, which now serves as the city prison. The city is built around the flanks of a hill, with the Manderly keep, New Castle, located the summit of the hill, which commands a wide view of the harbor and surrounding land.\n\nThe city was founded at the order of King Jon Stark several millennia ago to provide a trading link with the rest of Westeros. The Manderlys, exiled from the [[Kingdom of the Reach]], were given control of White Harbor a thousand years ago. It is thus the only settlement of the North in which a significant portion of the population follows the [[Faith of the Seven]] instead of the [[Old Gods of the Forest]], but there have been no major religiously-based tensions between the Manderlys and their neighbors.\n\nIn the novels, [[Catelyn Stark]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] use a ship from White Harbor to get to King's Landing around the same time that [[Eddard Stark]] and his party, travelling overland, arrive. However, in the television series there is no indication they used this method of travel.\n\n", "History": "===Background===\n\nCenturies ago, the [[White Knife]] River was infested with pirates, until the [[Stark]] [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] drove them away.&lt;ref&gt;[[House Bolton (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Generations later (but still before the [[War of Conquest|Targaryen Conquest]]), the Starks granted the rich lands around the mouth of the river to [[House Manderly]], an exiled family fleeing from [[the Reach]] where they used to hold lands along the [[Mander]] River.  Under the rule of House Manderly, White Harbor prospered and grew into the North's main port, and only settlement large enough to be called a &quot;city&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[The North (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Ros]] tells [[Theon Greyjoy]] she is taking a ship from White Harbor to get her to King's Landing as fast as possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\n[[Eddison Tollett]] informs Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] that the late [[Bannen]] hailed from White Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "White Harbor"}
