Baelor had entered the trial wearing his son's lighter armor, which did not fit properly and didn't provide adequate protection.  Maekar had not meant to severely harm Baelor, and Baelor seemed fine at first, acknowledging that it was an accident.  Soon, however, Baelor started behaving drunkenly, and he actually had a severe concussion from which he died in a matter of hours.  The guilt of accidentally killing his own brother haunted Maekar for the rest of his days.\n\nBaelor had two sons of his own, but they later died in the [[Great Spring Sickness]], along with Baelor and Maekar's father, old King [[Daeron II Targaryen]].  \n\nThe events surrounding the trial also convinced Maekar that Aerion was a psychopath unworthy to be his heir, and that he should focus on the upbringing of his younger son Aegon, then only a small boy better known by his nickname, &quot;Egg&quot;.  Through a series of events at the tournament and trial Ser Duncan had befriended Egg, and Maekar agreed to let Egg serve as Ser Duncan's squire as he traveled through Westeros, to give the young prince a better understanding of the world.  In later years, and several other deaths in the royal family, Egg succeeded his father as King [[Aegon V Targaryen]], and &quot;Dunk&quot; became the Lord Commander of his [[Kingsguard]].\n\n", "History": "===Background===\n\nWhile attending a [[Tournament|tournament]] at [[Ashford]] in [[The Reach|the Reach]], Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], a poor [[Knighthood#Types of knights|hedge-knight]], became smitten with a beautiful Dornish woman.  However, the arrogant Prince [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion &quot;Brightflame&quot; Targaryen]] accosted the young woman, at which Ser Duncan sprang to her defense - as any true knight should - and struck Prince Aerion.  To strike a member of the royal blood was treason, and the corresponding sentence would usually be the loss of the offending hand. Ser Duncan, however demanded a [[Trial by combat|trial by combat]], which, at the insistence of Prince Aerion, then became a rare &quot;trial of seven&quot;, involving two teams of seven men each.  \n\nSer Duncan's side was victorious, but during the combat Aerion's uncle Crown Prince [[Baelor Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Baelor &quot;Breakspear&quot; Targaryen]] accidentally took a severe head injury, and the resulting concussion killed him.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Kingsguard (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Trial by seven of Duncan the Tall"}
