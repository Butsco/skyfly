After an hour of waiting in the [[Red Keep]], the two ambassadors were introduced to [[Mira Forrester]]. Morgryn urged Andros to be polite after the latter became angry over Mira's presence, and continued to try to calm Andros to no avail. Tyrion ended his meeting with the two ambassadors in order to deal directly with Mira, and Morgryn asked him to reconsider their arrangement before leaving.\n\n===&quot;[[The Sword in the Darkness]]&quot;===\nMorgryn was invited to the [[Purple Wedding|royal wedding]]. While there, he conversed with [[Garibald Tarwick|Lord Garibald Tarwick]] and later prevented [[Lucan (Telltale)|Lucan]] from detaining Mira. Morgryn then warned her that Tyrion was trying to play [[House Forrester]] and House Whitehill against each other in order to secure the cheapest possible price for the ironwood. He began to offer his alliance with Mira, but they were interrupted by the assassination of [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey Baratheon]] and the arrest of Tyrion. Morgryn quickly left the scene, telling Mira to get the ironwood decree from Tyrion's chambers if she wished to forge an alliance with him.\n\n"}, "title": "Morgryn"}
