He is played by guest star [[Brian Fortune]]&lt;ref&gt;http://winteriscoming.net/2014/04/new-details-about-season-4-episodes-2-and-3/&lt;/ref&gt;. He debuts in &quot;[[You Win or You Die]].&quot; Othell Yarwyck is the [[First Builder]]; a senior position within the [[Night's Watch]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Yarwyck\u00c2\u00a0is not present when Jon Snow is taken before Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "During Season 1 it was believed that Fortune was playing [[Bowen Marsh]], and\u00c2\u00a0[[Dennis McKeever]] was playing Yarwyck, based on comments by Fortune and McKeever's character delivering\u00c2\u00a0a line said by Yarwyck in the books. Neither of them were absolutely confirmed to be playing these characters, however, as their names were never stated in on-screen dialogue or in the credits. McKeever reappeared in Seasons [[Season 2|2]] and [[Season 3|3]] in a background role in the [[Great Ranging]], in which Yarwyck didn't partake. In [[Season 4]], Fortune's character was directly identified in on-screen dialogue as Yarwyck, and [[Michael Condron]] was subsequently cast as Marsh for [[Season 5]]. This establishes that Fortune's character should always be considered to have been Yarwyck, while McKeever was simply playing [[Night's Watch Officer 2|an unnamed Night's Watch officer]]. While this might technically be a retcon, Season 1 never absolutely confirmed which characters these actors were playing, so it introduced no internal continuity errors.\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "Appearances": "{{Season One Appearances|7=yes|8=yes}}\n{{Season Four Appearances|yes||yes||||yes}}\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nOthell Yarwyck is [[First Builder]] of the [[Night's Watch]] and a member of [[House Yarwyck]], a noble house of [[the Westerlands]] sworn to [[Casterly Rock]].
