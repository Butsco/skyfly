Bear Island sits within the bay. Wildling raiders from the Frozen Shore sometimes raid across the Bay of Ice, attacking both Bear Island and the lands around [[Deepwood Motte]]. The [[ironborn]] at the height of their power were able to send [[Iron Fleet|longships]] into the Bay of Ice and controlled Bear Island for several centuries until losing it in a wrestling match to the [[King in the North]], who gifted it to a loyal retainer (who became the founder of [[House Mormont]]).\n\n"}, "title": "Bay of Ice"}
