It is part of [[the Stormlands]] and is held by [[House Tarth]], vassals of [[House Baratheon]], from their seat on [[Evenfall Hall]]. Being situated in the Narrow Sea, Tarth is located fairly close to the [[Free Cities]] of the eastern continent, particularly [[Tyrosh]]. It is also known as the Sapphire Isle due to the blue of the surrounding waters.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe castle of Tarth, located on the west coast of the island, is called Evenfall Hall. It is the home of [[Brienne of Tarth]], sometimes called the Maid of Tarth.  The island is ruled by Brienne's father, Lord [[Selwyn Tarth]].\n\n", "References": "{{reflist}}\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tarth is said to be a beautiful island. It is called the Sapphire Isle for the clear blue waters surrounding the island (but there are no real sapphires in it). The island contains mountains, waterfalls, high meadows, and shadowed vales.\n\n", "History": "=== [[Season 3]] ===\nWhen [[Locke]] was about to let his men rape Brienne, [[Jaime Lannister]] told him who she was and that Tarth was called the &quot;Sapphire Isle&quot; because every sapphire in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] was mined on it, to point out the wealth of her father. Locke relents and orders his men not to harm Brienne, as it would be more worthwhile to ransom her unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBrienne later pointed out that the &quot;Sapphire Isle&quot; is actually so-called because of the blue of its waters: there are no actual sapphire mines on the island.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[And Now His Watch is Ended]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Tarth"}
