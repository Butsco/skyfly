I know I'm a deserter.|[[Will]]|Winter is Coming}}\n\n[[File:Ned_Stark.jpg|thumb|264px|Will is executed for breaking his oath]]'''Desertion''' is a serious crime in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. It takes place when a man abandons his post, particularly in times of war. Deserters are considered [[outlaw]]s and thus are marked for death.\n\nWithin the ranks of the [[Night's Watch]], desertion is considered a form of [[oathbreaking]]. Deserters are not only hunted down by sworn brothers of the Watch but also by lords should a deserter enter his lands.\n\n", "Instances of desertion": "\n*[[Mance Rayder]], a [[ranger]] who deserted his post at the Night's Watch.\n* {[[Will]]}, a ranger of the Night's Watch, who fled south after witnessing [[White Walkers]] kill his sworn brothers [[Gared]] and [[Waymar Royce]]. Captured by men of [[House Stark]] and executed by Lord [[Eddard Stark]], [[Warden of the North]].\n*[[Jon Snow]] briefly deserts the Night's Watch upon learning of his father's [[Execution of Eddard Stark|execution]], intending to join his brother [[Robb Stark]]'s army. He is convinced to turn back by [[Samwell Tarly]]. [[Jeor Mormont]] pardons the indiscretion, remarking that if he executed every man who contemplated deserting, they would have no men left.\n*[[Sandor Clegane]] dismisses several members of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] as deserters from [[House Baratheon]] and House Stark. He is not entirely accurate, as the Brotherhood is initially formed by survivors of the [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford]], in which a host including Baratheon and Stark men clashed with Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].\n**Sandor Clegane\u00c2\u00a0himself deserted his position in the\u00c2\u00a0[[Kingsguard]]\u00c2\u00a0during the\u00c2\u00a0[[Battle of the Blackwater]].\n*{[[Rast]]}, {[[Karl]]}, and several other black brothers desert the Watch and [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|mutiny]] against Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] while taking refuge at the [[Craster's Keep|homestead]] of the [[wildling]] [[Craster]]. All were slain during the [[Raid on Craster's Keep]].\n\n"}, "title": "Desertion"}
