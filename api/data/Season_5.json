[[Westeros]] is on the brink of collapse, and many are seizing what they can while the realm implodes, like a corpse making a feast for crows.\n[[File:Cersei_refuses_to_share_her_plans.jpg|thumb|With Tywin dead and Tyrion gone, Queen Regent Cersei is now Head of House Lannister and tasked with the burden of continuing her father's legacy.]]\n[[Tywin Lannister]] is dead, shot on the privy by his long-abused dwarf son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. The crazed boy-king [[Joffrey Baratheon]], Tywin's grandson, is also dead after being poisoned at [[Purple Wedding|his own wedding]], and succeeded by his younger and more pliable brother, [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] succeeds her father as the head of [[House Lannister]], and once again takes over as [[Regent|Queen Regent]], as Tommen has yet to come of age. Cersei has been blocked by several powerful men over the years, including her husband King [[Robert Baratheon]] and his friend [[Eddard Stark]], but due to her betrayals they are both dead. Now with even Tywin and Joffrey dead, and Tyrion fleeing the realm, there are no more checks on Cersei's power, and she is essentially the Ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in all but name. However, Cersei is neither a master strategist nor a skilled diplomat (unlike her father and brother) and she faces mounting crises that would have strained even their abilities.\n\nHouse Lannister and its allies have\u00c2\u00a0managed to crush [[House Stark]], but in many ways it was a pyrrhic victory. The [[Iron Throne]] was already in [[Currency|massive debt]] to foreign banks before the war even began, and the Lannisters' immense wartime spending increased the crown's debts to crippling levels. The Lannisters must now desperately attempt to placate the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]], by far the largest of the foreign banks, and the one which the crown owes most of its huge debts to.\n[[File:Houndaryarideaway.png|thumb|The Riverlands have been reduced to a burned-out wasteland by the war.]]\nThe game of thrones is, unfortunately, not a simple game of [[cyvasse|''cyvasse'']] in which the pieces can be quickly reassembled: vast swathes of Westeros have been devastated by civil war, and it may take a full generation for them to rebuild. [[The Riverlands]], where most of the war was fought, have been reduced to a burned out husk. Nominally the Lannisters and their [[House Frey]] allies control the Riverlands, but it has been reduced to a lawless and corpse-filled devastation, hardly controlled by anyone. Winter is fast approaching, but instead of stockpiling harvests the past few years, the great lords have been busy destroying one of the main breadbasket regions of the Seven Kingdoms. Combined with the realm's massive debts to foreign banks, starvation level conditions are starting to set in for the [[Smallfolk|smallfolk]] across the realm. Outraged by the willful indifference of their rulers to their well-being for so long, commoners are starting to fall back onto old cultural touchstones, channeling their frustration into religious fanaticism. A [[Sparrows|popular disgust movement]] spreads across Westeros, and makes its way to the capital.\n[[File:Margaery wearing Cersei style clothes in Season 5.jpg|thumb|A power-struggle is growing between Cersei Lannister and Margaery Tyrell, now married to King Tommen.]]\nAdding to these woes is the increasing rivalry between the Lannisters and their Tyrell allies, specifically between Cersei and [[Margaery Tyrell]]. The Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with the armies and food resources won by their alliance with the [[House Tyrell]] of [[The Reach|the Reach]]. Now that Tywin is dead, and Margaery is soon to be King Tommen's queen, the Tyrells are no longer pretending to be polite to the Lannisters, but openly demanding greater concessions and key positions of power. With half of the Lannister armies slaughtered by [[Robb Stark]] during the war, their financial resources depleted, and the Tyrells controlling the only major breadbasket region untouched by the war, the Lannisters are having to face the reality that the Tyrells hold numerous advantages over them. Just as [[Robert Baratheon]] became king only to become dependent on the support of the Lannisters, the Lannisters have now become dependant on the Tyrells.\n[[File:Tyrion and Varys in Pentos.jpg|thumb|Tyrion and Varys flee to the Free Cities after Tyrion kills Tywin.]]\nWithout the political acumen of Tywin or Tyrion, Queen Regent Cersei struggles to address these major challenges. Adding even further to her woes is that the king's [[Small Council]] has been gutted, with [[Hand of the King]] Tywin dead, [[Master of Coin]] [[Petyr Baelish]] leaving for [[The Eyrie|the Eyrie]], and both Tyrion and [[Master of Whisperers]] [[Varys]] fleeing the capital city. Of the original Small Council when the Lannisters first seized power, only [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] remains.\n\nBesides the Reach, only the regions which have remained neutral so far still have all of their armies and resources intact: [[The Vale of Arryn|the Vale]], ruled by [[House Arryn]], and [[Dorne]], ruled by [[House Martell]]. With nearly all the other Great Houses defeated or half-exhausted, the fresh armies of the Vale and Dorne can drastically alter the political playing field, depending on which side they choose to join.\n[[File:Littlefinger and Alayne Season 5 trailer.jpg|thumb|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish, the true catalyst of the Stark-Lannister war, now rules as regent of the Vale, gathering his strength - and joined by his ward &quot;Alayne&quot;.]]\nThe ultimate result of the war was to exhaust the Starks, Lannisters, and other [[Great Houses]] of the Seven Kingdoms - exactly as Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish had planned. The secret architect of the conflict, it was Littlefinger who was responsible for poisoning Robert's Hand, [[Jon Arryn]], by conspiring with his own wife [[Lysa Arryn]]. Littlefinger then engineered the betrayal of [[Eddard Stark]], only to later assist [[Olenna Tyrell]] in assassinating King Joffrey [[Purple Wedding|at his own wedding]]. Baelish has now murdered Lysa, mere days after wedding her, and seized power over the Vale as regent for her young son. For the moment, Baelish remains in the Vale, consolidating his new hold over the Vale lords through his stepson [[Robin Arryn|Robin]] and his position as Lord Protector of the Vale. Alongside Baelish is the black-haired &quot;Alayne&quot;, his ward and &quot;niece&quot; - secretly, [[Sansa Stark]], who fell into Littlefinger's custody after he helped her escape her long imprisonment at Joffrey's royal court. \n[[File:Doran,_Ellaria,_Areo_%26_Sand_Snakes.png|thumb|The [[Dornishmen]] are furious over the death of Oberyn Martell in a duel with Gregor Clegane.]]\n[[File:Sand_Snakes_send_Cersei_Myrcella%27s_lion_pendant.png|thumb|[[Sand Snakes|Oberyn's daughters]] threaten Cersei by sending her a dead viper with her daughter Myrcella's lion pendant stuffed in its mouth.]]\nIn the deserts of the deep south of Westeros, the people of [[Dorne]] demand vengeance for the death of Prince [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn]], who died in a [[Second Trial by Combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] at the hands of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. Leading the call to enter the war against the Lannisters are Oberyn's paramour, [[Ellaria Sand]], and the eldest of [[Sand Snakes|his eight daughters]]: [[Obara Sand|Obara]], [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]], and [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]]. But [[Doran Martell]], the [[Prince of Dorne]] and Oberyn's older brother, may be of a different mind. Further complicating the matter is that early in the war, the Lannisters bribed the Martells into staying neutral by offering a marriage-alliance, sending Cersei's daughter [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to Dorne to betroth her to Doran's son [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]]. Myrcella is still a [[Ward|ward]] living in Dorne's capital, [[Sunspear]].\n[[File:Stannis_attacks.png|thumb|King Stannis Baratheon's forces unexpectedly arrived at the Wall to save the Night's Watch from Mance Rayder.]]\n\nThe most dire situation in Westeros, however, is in [[the North]] and at [[The Wall|the Wall]]. The [[Battle of Castle Black|massive assault against Castle Black]] by the [[Free Folk|wildling]] army of [[Mance Rayder]] was defeated at the last moment by the surprise arrival of [[Stannis Baratheon]] and his remaining forces. Stannis withdrew from his island stronghold [[Dragonstone (castle)|Dragonstone]] to reach the Wall by sea, to defend the realm of which he feels he is the only rightful king. With his home territories in [[The Stormlands|the Stormlands]] overrun, Stannis needs to win the allegiance of Robb Stark's defeated bannermen, to rally the North again as a springboard against Lannister rule, as well as the support of [[Jon Snow]], who therefore must walk a political tightrope between Stannis and his vows, since the [[Night's Watch]] is sworn to strict political neutrality. Though the battle against the wildlings is all but over, the Night's Watch is in its own dire conditions. With almost all of the Watch's top officers either killed or missing, among them Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] and First Ranger [[Benjen Stark]], the organization has been left leaderless during this time of crisis, and therefore will have to navigate a contentious [[Choosing|election for a new Lord Commander]]. All the while, the [[White Walkers]] and their ever-growing army of [[Wights|the dead]] are bearing down on the Wall itself, intent on spilling over it to destroy the lands of men beyond, ignorant of the long-forgotten but all-too-real danger.\n[[File:Red_wedding_roose_robb.png|thumb|Roose Bolton personally killed Robb Stark at the Red Wedding, and was appointed the new Warden of the North as a reward.]]\n[[File:Snow.jpg|thumb|Roose's psychotic son Ramsay is now Lord of Winterfell under his father, and has &quot;remade&quot; Theon Greyjoy into his broken servant, Reek.]]\nThe main armies of the Northern Houses, however, were slaughtered in the south at the [[Red Wedding]], and the large main army of [[House Bolton]] has just returned to the North following the [[Fall of Moat Cailin|recapture of Moat Cailin]]. The Boltons switched to the Lannister side during the betrayal at the Red Wedding, during which their leader Lord [[Roose Bolton]] personally killed Robb Stark, and they have been installed as the new rulers of the North in the name of King Tommen and the Lannisters. With the other Northern Houses defeated and weakened, the Lannister-backed Bolton army can now suppress any feeble opposition to their rule. Meanwhile, Roose's psychotic bastard son [[Ramsay Snow]] - now legitimized as Ramsay Bolton - is the new Lord of [[Winterfell]] under his father, reoccupying the castle which he [[Sack of Winterfell|personally burned out]] previously. With the Boltons in power, Ramsay is now free to commit numerous atrocities throughout the North, such as [[Flaying|flaying]] men alive and [[Tansy|hunting and killing]] young women for sport, which would normally have resulted in severe punishments under Stark rule.\n\nHowever, the struggle for the North is not yet over. Various areas of the North's western coast are still held by [[Ironborn|ironborn]] invaders under [[Balon Greyjoy]], who chose to crown himself as [[King of the Iron Islands]] and attack the North during Robb Stark's march south rather than ally with him against the Lannisters. Balon's son and heir, [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], who himself was a ward of Lord [[Eddard Stark]] and one of Robb's closest advisors, turned on the Starks and led the assault himself but was betrayed by his own men and is now a prisoner of the Boltons, having been brutally flayed, tortured, and psychologically broken by Ramsay himself, who has reduced Theon to his personal slave, &quot;Reek&quot;.[[File:Stannis Baratheon in Castle Black with Jon Snow.jpg|thumb|right|Jon must deal not only with the Watch but also with Stannis.]]\n[[File:Aemon_part_of_jon_s_judging.png|thumb|right|The Night's Watch faces a difficult election for a new Lord Commander.]]\n[[File:Titan_of_Braavos.jpg|thumb|right|The Free City of Braavos.]]\n[[Essos|East of Westeros]], after murdering his own father, [[Tyrion Lannister]] has fled across the [[Narrow Sea]] to the [[Free Cities]], his future intentions unknown even to himself. Accompanied by Varys, he arrives in the east, unaware that the erstwhile Master of Whisperers might yet have secrets to reveal. Further north, meanwhile, representatives from the Iron Throne travel to the Free City of [[Braavos]] to assuage the Iron Bank's frustrations about all of the money the Lannisters owe. Unbeknownst to all, [[Arya Stark]] has also fled to Braavos, due to a favor she was owed for saving the life of one of the mysterious guild of assassins in Braavos known as the [[Faceless Men]]. \n[[File:6f038a22773525ec3a2a270f79f892c3.jpg|thumb|Daenerys Targaryen has been forced to chain up her uncontrollable dragons.]]\n[[File:Dragons_imprisoned.png|thumb|The dragons chained in a cavern underneath Meereen.]]\nFurther east in [[Slaver's Bay]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s hold over [[Meereen]] has become very precarious, as ruling the city is becoming much more difficult than conquering it was. Sectarian violence is rampant between the former slaves and former [[Great Masters|slave-masters]], revenge attacks are on the rise, and the resurgent [[Wise Masters|slavers]] at [[Yunkai]] are rallying all those who oppose her. Daenerys's three [[Dragons|dragons]], now growing to dangerous size, have become uncontrollable and she can no longer rely upon them to defeat her enemies on the battlefield. [[Drogon]] burned a child to death while he was hunting and fled the city, forcing Daenerys to chain up the remaining two dragons in the caverns underneath the city. In addition, Daenerys is still distraught over the recent revelations concerning her once-trusted advisor [[Jorah Mormont]], whom she exiled from the city as punishment. Her remaining advisors Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], [[Missandei]], and the sellsword [[Daario Naharis]] attempt to help hold her reign together.  \n[[File:Dany Season 5 GOT HBO.jpg|thumb|Daenerys remains Queen of Meereen.]]\nBut unbeknownst to Daenerys, word has finally spread to Westeros that the last living Targaryen heir has hatched three live dragons. No longer a mere curiosity halfway across the world, several different factions in Westeros are now pondering how Daenerys and her dragons will factor into the already confusing and multi-sided civil war still tearing the Seven Kingdoms apart. Envoys are beginning to head east to court Daenerys's allegiance: but those who try to dance with dragons run the risk of being burned.\n\n", "TOP": "Season 5022501s8h6eethsbk5nirds1r3hxhoywqb07d1812512015-04-05T12:35:47ZEsam2144093847{{season\n| season   =5\n| image    = Gameofthrones-season5_poster.jpg\n| episodes =10\n| airdates =April 12, 2015 to June 21, 2015\n| production=July 18 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2014/10/2/welcome-to-season-5]&lt;/ref&gt;to&lt;br&gt;December 12 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-wraps-filming-season-5/ Game of Thrones wraps filming for Season 5]&lt;/ref&gt;\n| DVD      =TBA\n| previous =[[Season 4]]\n| next     =[[Season 6]]}}\n\n'''Season 5''' of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' was commissioned by [[HBO]] on 8 April 2014, following a substantial increase in audience figures between the [[Season 3|third]] and [[Season 4|fourth]] seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-renewed-two-more-694544 The Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth and [[Season 6|sixth]] seasons were commissioned simultaneously, the first time [[HBO]] has commissioned two seasons at once for a major drama series.\n\nThe season consists of ten episodes.

J. Murphy dies after beginning filming for Game of Thrones season 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Benioff and Weiss made an official statement via HBO's twitter account that the role will not be recast: &quot;We will not be recasting J.J. Murphy. He was a lovely man, and the best Denys Mallister we could have hoped for. And now his watch is ended.&quot; Apparently Season 5 will continue to use those scenes that Murphy already filmed, and possibly rewrite other scenes to work around his absence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s3hn4l Official statement from the creators of GameofThrones]&lt;/ref&gt; This will make Denys the second posthumous character appearing in the TV series (as well as the second cast member who has died): actress [[Margaret John]], who played [[Old Nan]], died only two months before Season 1 premiered, though all of her scenes had already been completed.\n\nOn August 24, 2014,\u00c2\u00a0WatchersOnTheWall.com reported that filming would again return to Diocletian's Palace in Croatia.

We have a season off. We have a year\u00e2&euro;&trade;s hiatus...Solely because, I imagine, our storyline is up to the end of the books. - So I get a year off now.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/toome-lockdown-game-thrones-filming-kristian-nairn-talks-season-5/ Kristian Nairn not to appear in Game of Thrones Season 5]&lt;/ref&gt; There was concern that Bran Stark would not appear either, since his storyline had almost reached the end of its material from the fifth and most recent novel, ''A Dance with Dragons'', but [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]], who plays Bran, seemed to imply he would be back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/09/04/isaac-hempstead-wright-confirms-appearance-season-5-game-thrones/]&lt;/ref&gt;\u00c2\u00a0However, it was later confirmed Bran would indeed not be in the fifth season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/11/05/game-of-thrones-why-bran-season-5/]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 2014, [[Art Parkinson]] ([[Rickon]]) confirmed that he and [[Natalia Tena]] ([[Osha]]) would not be returning in Season 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/10/06/art-parkinson-confirms-rickon-osha-still-awol/ Art Parkinson Confirms Rickon, Osha Still AWOL]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn October 14, 2014, ''Game of Thrones'' production units were observed filming in [[Wikipedia:C\u0102\u0142rdoba, Andalusia|C\u0102\u0142rdoba]], Spain, at the [[Wikipedia:Roman Bridge of C\u0102\u0142rdoba|Roman Bridge of C\u0102\u0142rdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordopolis.es/2014/10/14/juego-de-tronos-toma-el-puente-romano-de-cordoba/]&lt;/ref&gt; Benioff and Weiss confirmed that C\u0102\u0142rdoba will represent at least some shots of the Free City of [[Volantis]]. The city is located at the mouth of the massive [[Rhoyne]] River, and is famous for its &quot;[[Long Bridge]]&quot; which crosses over it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-filming-continues-roman-bridge-cordoba/]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThat same week, Benioff and Weiss spoke in a special event at the Teatro Central de Sevilla. They confirmed that there would be flashbacks in Season 5, despite their previous assertions that there would never be flashbacks on the TV show. They did experiment with using flashbacks in the unaired [[Pilot episode|pilot episode]], but afterwards felt that it broke up the dramatic pacing. The books themselves do not have straightforward &quot;flashback scenes&quot;, but POV narrators will remember or recall past events at length (i.e. when Jaime explains why he actually killed the Mad King, in &quot;[[Kissed by Fire]]&quot;). A drawback of this has been that they cannot always easily fit long expository speeches recounting large blocks of backstory into episodes (without resorting to [[Sexposition]]), so several major backstory events have only been briefly mentioned in passing (such as [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]). By Season 5, however, they have reached a point where there was no way to easily explain certain backstory events other than with flashback scenes. This apparently confirms earlier casting reports which indicated that there will be flashback scenes featuring Young Cersei. What remains to be seen, however, is if these flashback scenes will be presented as ''objectively'' true, with an omniscient camera, or if they will be based on the ''subjective'' recollection of the characters, ''[[Wikipedia:Rashomon effect|Rashomon]]''-style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/flashbacks-volantis-filming-confirmed-game-thrones-season-5/]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Adaptation===\n:''See main article on &quot;[[Game of Thrones (TV series)#Future seasons, and catching up with the books]]&quot;''\n\nWhile developing Season 4, Benioff admitted that &quot;Season 5 gives him nightmares&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypable.com/2013/07/22/game-of-thrones-season-4-comic-co/]&lt;/ref&gt;.\u00c2\u00a0However, once they actually had outlined the season, Benioff\u00c2\u00a0and D.B. Weiss revealed &quot;the fear started to dissipate.&quot;\u00c2\u00a0Season 5 will be &quot;drawing heavily&quot; from ''A Feast for Crows'' and ''A Dance with Dragons'', the fourth and fifth books of George R.R. Martin's ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' saga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/06/18/game-of-thrones-season-5]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe book series was originally planned as a trilogy (''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Dance with Dragons''\u00c2\u00a0and ''The Winds of Winter''), but Martin realized his plot of &quot;book one&quot;\u00c2\u00a0would have to be expanded into three novels\u00c2\u00a0(''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings''\u00c2\u00a0and ''A Storm of Swords''), which means\u00c2\u00a0the first three books are &quot;Act One&quot; of a three Act story. In fact, the climax of ''A Storm of Swords'' concludes many of the plot lines begun in ''A Game of Thrones''. Furthermore, what Martin originally planned as the middle novel\u00c2\u00a0[[Meereenese Knot#In the books|grew too vast]] to be published as a single tome, so he cut it into two books that take place concurrently: in very rough terms, the fourth one (''A Feast for Crows'') follows all of the characters in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]\u00c2\u00a0while the fifth one (''A Dance with Dragons'') covers the\u00c2\u00a0storylines\u00c2\u00a0that take place elsewhere (such as the Night's Watch at the Wall, Tyrion as he escapes to the Free Cities, and Daenerys in Slaver's Bay). Season 5 will present the events featured in these two books in chronological order, intercutting between the two clusters of\u00c2\u00a0storylines.\n\nOn the one hand, the combination of the fourth and fifth novels could easily span two seasons, since this fusion would be longer\u00c2\u00a0than ''A Storm of Swords'', which was adapted into the third and fourth seasons (although the latter dipped into the following two books as well.) On the other hand, whereas\u00c2\u00a0the [[Red Wedding]]\u00c2\u00a0happens around the middle of the third novel and provided a convenient climax for Season 3, there are no similarly game-changing or climactic events in the middle of ''A Feast for Crows'' or ''A Dance with Dragons''.\n\nUltimately, judging by filming news and trailers featuring characters and events that belong to\u00c2\u00a0the climax of the fifth book, it seems that at least several storylines will reach the end of the fifth and most recent\u00c2\u00a0book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-season-five-cast-announced-comic-con/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://watchersonthewall.com/preparations-walk-begun-dubrovnik/ Preparations for the Walk have begun in Dubrovnik, Split stands ready - '''WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS ALERT!''']&lt;/ref&gt; Other storylines, however, may not yet reach the end of the latest material, as the TV series has never rigidly followed the outline of the novels. Specifically, while Bran Stark's and Sansa Stark's storylines were already nearly out of published material by the end of Season 4, Jon Snow is still not finished with all of his storyline from the third novel, and the ironborn have been put on the back burner for the last two seasons, appearing for just a few minutes in each of them. Therefore, the rate at which each storyline exhausts its material will probably vary from one to the next, as it has in previous seasons.\n\n===Cast===\n====Returning starring cast====\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/25161/20140616/game-of-thrones-cast-peter-drinklage-toronto-shae-tyrion.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/07/26/interview-roundup-game-thrones-san-diego-comic-con/]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/17/game-of-thrones-lena-headey-on-cersei-lannister-s-future-and-that-controversial-rape-scene.html]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Emilia Clarke]] as Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]]&lt;ref name=&quot;New Series Regulars&quot;
