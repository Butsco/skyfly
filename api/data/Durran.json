He is deceased when the series begins and has only appeared in the [[Complete Guide to Westeros]] and [[Histories &amp; Lore]] featurettes.\n\nDurran was a legendary [[First Men]] figure of the [[Age of Heroes]] and the first of the [[Storm Kings]], who ruled the [[Stormlands]] until the [[Targaryen]] invasion of [[Westeros]]. According to legend, Durran won the love of [[Elenei]], daughter of the [[God of the Sea|sea god]] and the [[Goddess of the Wind|wind goddess]], and took her as his wife.\n\nIn rage, the gods sent a storm to destroy his keep over [[Shipbreaker Bay]], killing his family and guests. Declaring war against them, Durran built new castles, each larger and more formidable than the previous one, though all were the destroyed by the divine storms. Finally, the seventh castle, which Durran built with the aid of either the [[Children of the Forest]] or a very young [[Brandon Stark (the Builder)|Bran the Builder]], withstood the rage of the gods and became known as [[Storm's End]], while Durran earned the nickname of &quot;Durran's Godsgrief&quot; and ruled as the first [[Storm King]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Age of Heroes (Complete Guide to Westeros)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Stormlands (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDurran's dynasty, [[House Durrandon]], perished with the death of [[Argilac Durrandon]]. However, [[House Baratheon]] descends from it through its female bloodline.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[House Baratheon (Complete Guide to Westeros)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "Image Gallery": "&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nDurran elenei.jpg|Durran, a mortal man, fell in love with Elenei, immortal daughter of gods\nMarkIStormsEnd.png|Durran's first castle\nMarkIIStormsEnd.png|Durran's second castle\nDurran stormsend.jpg|Durran Godsgrief, with his Queen Elenei, before Storm's End, his seventh and final castle\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n"}, "title": "Durran"}
