Pyat Pree\u00c2\u00a0suddenly appears and chains Daenerys\u00c2\u00a0with magic, saying that her dragons make his magic strong, that she makes the dragons stronger, and thus she must stay in the House of the Undying forever. An unconcerned Daenerys whispers &quot;dracarys&quot; to\u00c2\u00a0Drogon, and after a couple of tries, he spits a large plume of fire at Pyat, igniting the warlock's robes. The other two dragons follow their brother's lead and the three of them burn Pyat Pree alive, free themselves and Daenerys from their chains, and set the House of the Undying alight.\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\nDrogon has grown significantly since leaving Qarth, and is about the size of a small dog by the time Daenerys and her party reach [[Astapor]]. He swoops into the water and catches a fish, which he proceeds to cook in mid air and devour. Daenerys notes that he is not growing fast enough for her to use him to conquer the Seven Kingdoms in the immediate future.\n\nAt the slavers bay, she speaks with [[Kraznys\u00c2\u00a0mo Nakloz|Kraznys&amp;nbsp;mo Nakloz]], as they attempt to work out a deal for his slave soldiers, the [[Unsullied]]. Daenerys says she will take all eight thousand Unsullied, including those in training. To this Kraznys laughs at her and says with everything she came with she could afford hardly over one hundred Unsullied. Daenerys surprises him by reminding him she has Dragons, and she will give him one. They strike a deal that she may have all the Unsullied, as well as those still in training, in exchange for her biggest dragon.\n\n[[File:Drogon kills Kraznys S3E4.jpg|thumb|left|Drogon burns Kraznys during the Sack of Astapor.]]\nSometime later the exchange is made, Daenerys meets with the [[Good Masters]] and gives the chained Drogon over to Kraznys, who in turn gives her the golden scourge which signals absolute authority over the Unsullied. Once the Unsullied are under her command, Kraznys comments that Drogon does not obey him, to which she responds, in Valyrian, that he does not obey because dragons are not slaves, before ordering Kraznys's death with a harsh &quot;dracarys&quot;. Drogon then takes flight and strafes the guards and Good Masters in the walls above the plaza.\n\n[[File:Dragons S3E4.jpg|thumb|204px|Daenerys marches forward with her army and dragons.]]\n\nAfter the [[Sack of Astapor]] is finished, Daenerys' khalasar and her new Unsullied army march out of the city, Drogon and his brothers flying overhead.\n\n[[File:Dragons at Yunkai.png|thumb|left|Rhaegal, Drogon and Viserion at Yunkai]]\n\nDrogon and his brothers are present in Daenerys' tent when a Wise Master from [[Yunkai]] arrives to entreat with their mother. Drogon\u00c2\u00a0aggressively\u00c2\u00a0barks at the Master when he gets to close to Daenerys. Later the Slave Master\u00c2\u00a0has two slaves place a chest full of gold near\u00c2\u00a0Drogon. While the two talk Daenerys throws a piece of meat to Viserion, and Drogon attempts to steal it from his brother. When the negotiation goes sour, Drogon\u00c2\u00a0growls at the Slave Master for threatening Daenerys. Scared for his safety,\u00c2\u00a0the Slave masters tells his slaves to take back the gold and attempt to leave, Drogon stops them in their tracks, hissing and growling.\n\n===[[Season 4]] ===\n[[File:Drogon snarls at his mom.jpg|thumb|left|Drogon snarls a warning at his mother when she tries to interrupt his feeding.]]\nDrogon and his siblings are now the size of small horses. He quietly rests his head on his mother's lap, taking joy as she caresses him. When his two siblings come back with a dead lamb, he joins the fight over the carcass. His mother tries to calm him down, and without warning, Drogon snaps at her with a hiss; a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill. Daenerys is shaken that she is losing influence over her &quot;children&quot;, as dragons can never be truly tamed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Drogon Goat take out.jpg|thumb|Drogon preys on goats near Meereen.]]\nDrogon, who is now the size of a small ship,\u00c2\u00a0kills and eats the goats of a local\u00c2\u00a0[[Goatherd (The Laws of Gods and Men)|goatherd]]\u00c2\u00a0outside Meereen.
