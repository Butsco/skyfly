He was portrayed by\u00c2\u00a0[[Rob Ostlere]]. He was sworn brother of the [[Night's Watch]] who was killed by [[White Walkers]].\n\n", "Appearance": "{{Season One Appearances|yes}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Royce of [[Runestone]] is distantly related to [[House Stark]]. He is the third and youngest son of &quot;Bronze&quot; Yohn Royce, and therefore having little chance of inheriting lands or wealth, he joined the Night's Watch. Waymar was fast-tracked to being an officer because of his noble blood. Eighteen-year-old Waymar is a skilled warrior, trained by his castle's master-at-arms, but is untested in battle. He is arrogant and has a tendency to underrate the experience of other men due to their lower birth, even though they have been serving on the Wall for longer than he has, but he is not completely stupid.\n\nNonetheless, when the Others - as the White Walkers are known in the novels - appear he bravely attempts to fight one in single combat. However, his sword shatters as soon as it touches the ice-sword of the Other, and he is defeated and killed. When Will surveys the damage and retrieves Royce's shattered sword Royce revives as a [[wight]], his eyes now icy blue, and murders Will.\n\nThe young Sansa (who was less than 11 years old at the time) developed a massive romantic crush on the handsome young man in the brief time he and his father stayed at Winterfell before he departed to the Wall.\n\n", "Behind the scenes": "[[File:Jamie_as_Waymar.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jamie Campbell Bower]] as Waymar Royce in the unaired [[pilot episode]].]]\nIn the [[Pilot episode|unaired pilot episode]] he was played by [[Jamie Campbell Bower]], but was recast with [[Rob Ostlere]] when\u00c2\u00a0the opening scene\u00c2\u00a0was re-shot.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nSer Waymar Royce was a [[Knighthood|knight]] and the youngest son of [[House Royce]], a noble family of the [[Vale of Arryn]].
