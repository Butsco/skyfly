He has a long list of TV and film credits, including roles in ''[[wikipedia:Hornblower (TV series)|Hornblower]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Cold Feet (TV series)|Cold Feet]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Queer as Folk|Queer as Folk]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:The Tudors (TV series)|The Tudors]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' he is playing the role of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. He was announced in the role on 12 July 2010.\n\nSome of the actors on the TV series prefer to learn about the story through the script, one season at a time. For example [[Julian Glover]], who plays [[Pycelle]], has made it a point in his career that when he is filming literary adaptations, it is the task of the writers to translate the story from page to screen, and he doesn't want to second guess them. In contrast, Ian McElhinney has thoroughly read through the book series and is quite familiar with its internal history - which is entirely fitting, given that Ser Barristan is one of the older characters in the story and spent over forty years at the royal court, and personally experienced many of the major political events of the past half-century. For example when Barristan is recalling Daenerys's dead older brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] (in Season 3 episode 3 &quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;), &quot;Rhaegar&quot; was more than just a name to McElhinney: he knew from the books just how well Barristan knew Prince Rhaegar, and how earnestly reverent he was of the man.\n\n", "Filmography": "*Lamb - Maguire (1985)\n*The End of the World Man - Architecht (1986)\n*A Prayer for the Dying - Lodger (1987)\n*Wipe Out - Max Raines (1988)\n*Streetwise - Denny Moss (1989)\n*The Playboys - Joe Cassidy (1992)\n*The Bill - Mickey Felcher (1992)\n*Blind Justice - Father Malone (1994)\n*Small Faces - Uncle Andrew (1996)\n*Hamlet - Barnardo (1996)\n*Wokenwell - Sgt.
