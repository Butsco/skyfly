He greets Eddard when he arrives in King's Landing and summons him to the small council but rather than suggesting that he change he actually provides clothing for him. It is the steward rather than [[Renly Baratheon]] who summons Eddard after Robert's hunting accident in the books. As in the series he appears again to summon Eddard when Joffrey takes the throne.
