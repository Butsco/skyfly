He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it starts. Ser Arthur Dayne was a [[knight]] of [[House Dayne]] who bore the title of &quot;the Sword of the Morning&quot; and a member of the [[Kingsguard]] of [[Aerys II Targaryen]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels,\u00c2\u00a0Ser Arthur Dayne was a knight who had achieved legendary status by the time the events of the books take place. As the wielder of the greatsword Dawn, a blade said to have been forged from metal from the heart of a fallen star, he bears the title of &quot;the Sword of the Morning&quot;. He was a close friend of Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]].\n\nIt was Arthur Dayne who [[Knight|knighted]] [[Jaime Lannister]] as a reward for his valor at the battle against the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]].\n\nArthur Dayne is remembered as the greatest knight of his generation, not only in martial skill but in value and virtue as a true knight. Even [[Barristan Selmy]], a living legend in his own right, thought that Ser Arthur surpassed himself in all respects. Ser Barristan, Jaime Lannister, and even Eddard Stark were all in awe of Ser Arthur, and recall him with nothing less than complete reverence. The fact that Arthur Dayne used to stand by and do nothing while [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] performed his atrocities did not taint his reputation at all.\n\nWhen asked who would win in a duel, [[George R.R. Martin]] said that if Arthur Dayne and Barristan Selmy fought with any swords it would be a very even fight - but if Dayne was armed with his sword Dawn, he would narrowly have the advantage over Selmy.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\n[[File:BookOfBrothersDayne.jpg|thumb|300px|Ser Arthur's and Ser Gerold's entries in the Book of Brothers]]\nSer Arthur was the second son of [[Beric Dayne]], Lord of Starfall. As the wielder of the sword [[Dawn]], which had been forged from the metal of a fallen star, he bore the title of &quot;the [[Sword of the Morning]]&quot;.\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nWhile checking ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'', King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] passingly reads through the entry on Ser Arthur Dayne, mentioning his leading of the attack on the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]] and his defeat of the [[Smiling Knight]], one of its members, in single combat. The Book of Brothers also mentions he was granted temporary command over the Kingsguard after Lord Commander [[Gerold Hightower]] suffered injuries. He perished in [[Robert's Rebellion]] alongside Ser Gerold and Ser [[Oswell Whent]] at the [[Red Mountains]] of [[Dorne]], [[Showdown at the Red Mountains|fighting]] Lord [[Eddard Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Arthur Dayne"}
