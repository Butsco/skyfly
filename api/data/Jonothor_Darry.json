Just like most of the other members of the Kingsguard at the time, he too was fiercely loyal to his oaths, fighting for the crown during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. \n\nHe was present at the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Bells]] to rally the remaining royal forces and later on lead the army of the royalists to the [[Battle of the Trident]], alongside Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], Prince [[Lewyn Martell]] and Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. He died at the Trident fighting until the end for his cause.\n\nAlthough [[Jaime Lannister]] remembers him as a earnest and honorable man, he did nothing against the atrocities committed by the Mad King, not even intervening when the King raped Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]].
