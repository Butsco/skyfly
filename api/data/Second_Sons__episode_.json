Barristan explains that although there are only 2,000 of them, the Second Sons are armored and mounted, enough to cause trouble for the [[Unsullied]]. Daenerys tells Barristan to organize a meeting with the Second Sons' captains, saying that men who fight for gold &quot;can't afford to lose to a girl&quot;.\n\nShortly thereafter, Daenerys, hosts the captains [[Mero]], a [[Braavos]]i also known as the Titan's Bastard, and [[Prendahl na Ghezn]], a Ghiscari. Also in attendance is Prendahl's capable and\u00c2\u00a0striking lieutenant, [[Daario Naharis]]. The uncouth and sexually vulgar Mero makes himself at home, observes that Daenerys looks like a whore he knows in [[Lys]] and feels up [[Missandei]], although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off. Prendahl and Mero refuse Daenerys' offer of an alliance, pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the [[Iron Throne]], which is still a distant prospect. With aplomb she replies that a fortnight previous she had no army, and a year before that she had no dragons. Smiling gently\u00c2\u00a0she gives them two days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine Mero\u00c2\u00a0had demanded. Daario smiles over his back at her as\u00c2\u00a0they depart. Daenerys instructs Barristan that if they must fight the Second Sons, he is to kill Mero first. He replies that he would be glad to do so.\n\nAt the mercenary camp, Mero fondles a Yunkish pleasure-slave while discussing the situation with Prendahl and Daario. It swiftly becomes apparent that Daario and Mero do not agree, but Prendahl cuts off their philosophical discussion to call for action over &quot;the dragon bitch.&quot; They eventually decide to simply assassinate Daenerys and be done with it. Mero gives the slave three coins, one each from [[Volantis]], [[Meereen]], and [[Braavos]], and tells her to randomly give them to the three mercenaries \u00e2&euro;&ldquo; the one who gets the [[Braavos]]i coin will kill the queen.\n\n[[File:Daario_threatens_Missandei.jpg|thumb|Daario (dressed as an Unsullied) holds a knife at Missandei's throat.]]\nThat night, as Daenerys bathes, she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than nineteen languages. Missandei says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]]. The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only ''reasonable ''Dothraki and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an Unsullied enters and hold a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He explains he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a philosophical disagreement over her beauty. He then produces their severed heads. Intrigued, Daenerys rises from her bath and asks if Daario will swear fealty to her. He bends the knee and swears his sword, his men and his heart to Daenerys.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\n[[File:White_walker_dies_S3E8.jpg|thumb|Sam slays a White Walker.]][[Samwell Tarly]] and [[Gilly]] continue on their journey to [[Castle Black]], taking refuge in a destroyed cabin next to a [[heart tree]]. Before they enter, two crows land on a branch on the heart tree, and begin to squawk loudly.\n\nLater at night, Sam tries to light a fire, but is frustrated in his attempts; Gilly tries and does it easily. Meanwhile, Sam suggests that Gilly name her son, but she does not know any boy names. Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. Gilly likes the name [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]], Sam's\u00c2\u00a0father's first name, but Sam asks\u00c2\u00a0her not to give the child that name. Sam shares the\u00c2\u00a0truth\u00c2\u00a0about his\u00c2\u00a0father and his upbringing marked by cruelty which they both had\u00c2\u00a0in common.\n\nSuddenly, they are interrupted by\u00c2\u00a0a thunderous\u00c2\u00a0squawking of the crows. Sam and Gilly go outside to investigate, and discover hundreds of crows filling the nearby tree and on the structure itself screeching violently. Gilly is then horrified to see a [[White Walkers|White Walker]] approaching them, and knows that it is after her child. Sam tries to halt its advance, but the Walker shatters his sword with\u00c2\u00a0its bare hand and knocks him aside,\u00c2\u00a0then continues to\u00c2\u00a0bear down upon her. As the monster reaches out to seize the infant, Sam staggers back to his feet, pulls out his [[dragonglass]] dagger, and attacks the Walker, stabbing it in the back. The Walker howls in pain as its whole body begins to freeze from the point at which it was stabbed. It falls to its knees, and shatters, leaving nothing but white dust and the dagger. The dagger is left behind as Sam and\u00c2\u00a0Gilly race away in a panic.\u00c2\u00a0The crows fly out of the trees and chase them, screaming their hatred.\n\n===In the Seven Kingdoms===\n[[Arya Stark]], now a captive of [[Sandor Clegane]]\u00c2\u00a0after he kidnapped her from the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]],\u00c2\u00a0picks up a rock and stands over him planning to\u00c2\u00a0strike.\u00c2\u00a0She thinks he is sound asleep. He opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him, and kill him, but if she fails he will break her hands.\u00c2\u00a0Later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her.\u00c2\u00a0Sandor points out that for all she hates him, Arya could have been taken captive by someone far worse.\u00c2\u00a0He tells her about Sansa and how he [[Riot of King's Landing|rescued her]] from a group of would-be rapists. Arya disbelieves this, but Sandor says &quot;Ask your sister if you ever see her again.&quot; They arrive\u00c2\u00a0at a\u00c2\u00a0river which\u00c2\u00a0Arya initially thinks to be the [[Blackwater]]. Rather confused with her\u00c2\u00a0lack of understanding he\u00c2\u00a0points out that\u00c2\u00a0the river is the [[Red Fork]]\u00c2\u00a0of the [[Trident]]. Arya believed he was taking her back to [[King's Landing]], but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to [[The Twins]], where her mother and brother will shortly be attending her uncle's wedding, and he will ransom her to them. He tells her ruefully that if she wasn't so busy trying to kill him they might make it in time for the wedding. Arya has a small and hidden smile as the Hound spurs the horse to a gallop.\n\n[[Melisandre]] finally arrives back at [[Dragonstone ]] &lt;span style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;\u00c2\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;with [[Gendry]] in tow. [[Stannis]] is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew\u00c2\u00a0and is bemused when Melisandre orders him fed, bathed and clothed. He\u00c2\u00a0believes it is\u00c2\u00a0pointless as they intend to sacrifice him, but Melisandre reveals it is merely a sham to keep Gendry feeling secure, in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Davos Seaworth]],\u00c2\u00a0still languishing in his cell, is paid a visit by Stannis; Davos\u00c2\u00a0is told of the impending sacrifice of Gendry. Davos protests this saying\u00c2\u00a0that unlike [[Renly]]\u00c2\u00a0who was a rebel against his rightful king, Gendry is an innocent who has never done him any wrong.\u00c2\u00a0Stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory, which Stannis believes is the only way to save every man, woman and child in Westeros from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path. He asks how Davos can doubt the power of [[R'hllor|Melisandre's God]]&lt;span style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;\u00c2\u00a0&lt;/span&gt; when Stannis has seen visions of &quot;a great battle in the snow&quot; and Davos saw the [[Shadow|creature]]\u00c2\u00a0she gave birth to. Davos speculates that the real reason Stannis came is because deep down, a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew Davos would tell him the truth he needs to hear, regardless of how it would be taken. After extracting a promise from Davos that he won't act against Melisandre again, Stannis has him released.\n\n[[File:Stannis_and_leeches.jpg|thumb|Stannis naming the 3 usurpers.]]\nIn Gendry's quarters, Melisandre seduces Gendry long enough to distract him, then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on\u00c2\u00a0his body. She explains as Stannis and Davos enter the room that Davos wanted a demonstration of the power in king's blood, then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier. As part of the magical ritual that follows, Stannis throws the leeches into the flames at Melisandre's direction, and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn: &quot;The usurper [[Robb Stark]], the usurper [[Balon Greyjoy]], the usurper [[Joffrey Baratheon]]&quot;.\n\nAt [[King's Landing]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] speaks with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] before their wedding at the Great Sept of Baelor; though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him. Tyrion promises Sansa that he will not mistreat her, and Sansa agrees there are worse Lannisters she could be wed to. Prior to the wedding,\u00c2\u00a0[[Margaery Tyrell]]\u00c2\u00a0tries to ingratiate with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], commenting they will technically be sisters soon; Cersei responds by telling Margaery the story behind the &quot;[[Rains of Castamere]]&quot;, relating how it refers to the destruction of [[House Reyne]]\u00c2\u00a0of Castamere after their failed rebellion against [[House Lannister]] (inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of Houses Reyne and Tyrell and\u00c2\u00a0that the same fate may fall upon [[House Tyrell]] if they plot against the Lannisters) and concludes by threatening to have Margaery strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call Cersei sister again. The ceremony is a grim affair; Joffrey smugly escorts Sansa to the altar in place of [[Eddard Stark|her father]]\u00c2\u00a0and removes the stool upon which Tyrion was to stand\u00c2\u00a0on to cloak Sansa in Lannister colors as part of the ceremony. This elicits sniggers from the congregation (though the scowl of [[Tywin Lannister|Lord Tywin]]\u00c2\u00a0quickly silences them).\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion in the face of humiliation\u00c2\u00a0asks Sansa to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders. The\u00c2\u00a0[[High Septon (After the riot of King's Landing)|new High Septon]]\u00c2\u00a0begins the ceremony. Later as man and wife they have their reception dinner, which proves a grim and\u00c2\u00a0miserable affair.\n\n[[File:Tyrion_threatens.jpg|thumb|Tyrions threatens Joffrey.]]\nTyrion spends the wedding feast mostly by\u00c2\u00a0getting deeply drunk and making light of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife. Tyrion, drunkenly proclaiming himself &quot;the god of tits and wine&quot;, reminds his father that Tywin has long called him &quot;a drunken little lust-filled beast&quot;, so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem. At the same time, Joffrey is himself drinking too much wine, and losing what few inhibitions he has, his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both Sansa and Tyrion. Against Cersei's ineffectual protests, Joffrey gets up and flanked by his Kingsguard, taunts Sansa that she's still found a way to marry a Lannister. Joffrey then ponders that it doesn't matter which Lannister gets her pregnant, and openly says he might want to rape her after Tyrion is done with her, while the Kingsguard hold her down.\n\nJoffrey then declares it time for the [[bedding]] ceremony (which involves the men at the wedding stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed) but Tyrion angrily insists there will be no bedding. When Joffrey keeps pushing the matter, Tyrion slams his dagger into the table and threatens that Joffrey will &quot;be fucking [his] own bride with a wooden cock&quot; if he doesn't let it drop. As the court stands in\u00c2\u00a0shocked silence,\u00c2\u00a0Joffrey seethes with outrage and Tyrion glares at his nephew with\u00c2\u00a0pure hatred. After a tense moment Tywin defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony, and placates Joffrey by claiming Tyrion's outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk. Taking the hint, Tyrion visibly swallows\u00c2\u00a0his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is, intentionally humiliating himself, and says he only made a bad joke. It isn't clear if anyone in the room, including Tywin or Joffrey, think that Tyrion's outburst was simply due to being very drunk, but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass. Finally Tyrion, while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand, escorts Sansa to their bedchamber.\n\nOnce they are alone in their quarters, a tense moment passes as Sansa nervously and slowly undresses. Tyrion ultimately tells her to stop, deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to, and only will if she changes her mind. When Sansa questions what he will do if she never does, Tyrion sarcastically jokes &quot;And now my watch begins&quot; - implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the Night's Watch - and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch. The following morning, [[Shae]] notices with a hint of a smile that Sansa's bed sheets are not stained with blood and Tyrion's virgin bride is still a virgin.\n\n", "Notes": "*There was a two-week break between &quot;Second Sons&quot; and &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot;, due to the Memorial Day holiday on May 26th in the United States. Since HBO is a premium channel, they usually don't bother skipping holiday weeks as network and cable broadcasters do. However, &quot;[[Blackwater]]&quot; aired over Memorial Day in 2012 and took a slight dip in TV ratings, so [[HBO]] opted to just take the week off for Season 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/#/schedule HBO Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The title of the episode refers to the [[Second Sons (mercenary company)|Second Sons]], a [[mercenary]] company in [[Essos]], which is led by [[Mero]], nicknamed &quot;The Titan's Bastard&quot;.\n**The Second Sons in the TV series have been condensed with a second mercenary company which Meereen hired, the Stormcrows. In the books, Mero is captain of the Second Sons while Prendhal na Ghezn is a captain of the Stormcrows, and Daario is Prendahl's lieutenant.\n**On a looser level, the entire episode deals with &quot;second sons&quot; of various forms: Tyrion is the spurned younger son of Tywin Lannister, and is being forced into marriage to further his father's plans; Sandor is the second Clegane son, but unlike his brother Gregor he has turned his back on the Lannisters; Stannis was the second Baratheon son after Robert, and is struggling with how to claim the throne of his deceased brother; Gendry is ''functionally'' a &quot;second son&quot; (a less well-regarded son) due to his bastard status; similar to Gendry, Samwell talks with Gilly about how his father was cruel to him - even though Sam actually was his father's firstborn son, he considered Sam a disgrace and functionally the &quot;second son&quot; behind Sam's younger brother.\n*The doll that sits next to Sansa Stark's mirror in her first scene of the episode is the same one that her father [[Eddard Stark]] gave to her as a gift back in episode 3 of Season 1, &quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;, though at the time she said she was too old to play with dolls. Eddard said it was made by the same toymaker who produces dolls for Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]].\n*Sansa apparently covered Tyrion with a blanket some time after he passed out on the couch (unless he got up in the middle of the night, but it's strongly implied that we are later shown when he first wakes up).\n*Sansa stated that she was thirteen years old when Cersei asked her in the first episode of Season 1. Two seasons later, she says in this episode that she is fourteen, not fifteen. Other statements imply a general rule that one season equals one year within the storyline, so it might simply be that ''almost'' two years have passed, and Sansa herself just hasn't reached her fifteenth [[nameday]] yet.\n*This is the first time that [[Samwell Tarly]]'s father has been explicitly referred to in-dialogue as [[Randyll Tarly]]. Sam just referred to him as &quot;my father&quot; in Seasons 1 and 2. Lord Randyll's name was first mentioned in dialogue by [[Davos Seaworth]] in the Season 2 premiere, though he didn't mention that he had a son named Samwell.\n*The significance of [[dragonglass]] is finally revealed: the substance is lethal to White Walkers. The cache of dragonglass daggers was discovered at the [[Fist of the First Men]] in episode 8 of Season 2, &quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot; (exactly one season ago), but none of those who found it had any guess as to its purpose.\n**TV viewers might think it foolish that Sam left the dragonglass dagger on the ground where the White Walker died, instead of recovering such a valuable weapon. In the books, Samwell only had one dragonglass dagger (which Mormont gave him as he was dying), and indeed recovered it after killing the White Walker.  However, the next time that Samwell appears in the TV series (two episodes from now in &quot;[[Mhysa]]&quot;) he reveals that he simply had multiple daggers in the TV version (and thus apparently didn't think it was worth the risk of wasting time trying to find his first one, fearing that more White Walkers or wights would soon arrive).  \n*The White Walker appearing this episode is [[White Walker (Valar Morghulis)|visually identical]] to the one Sam encountered at the [[Battle of the Fist of the First Men]]. However, Gilly says that he is here to take her son, suggesting he is the same one that Jon Snow [[White Walker (The Night Lands)|encountered]] at [[Craster's Keep]].\n**The White Walker was played by [[Ross Mullan]], who also played the White Walker in &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot;, so it can be assumed this is meant to be the same character (Craster's White Walker was played by [[Ian Whyte]]).\n*This episode was nominated for the 2013 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emmys.com/shows/game-thrones&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Tyrion referring to himself as &quot;the God of Tits and Wine&quot; is a reference to a joke he makes in the [[Season 2]] episode &quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;, in which he asked Varys: &quot;The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned. The Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?&quot;\n\n"}, "title": "Second Sons (episode)"}
