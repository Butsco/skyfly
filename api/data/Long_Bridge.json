It is a great span with a road supported by massive piers that the Valyrians built at the height of their glory. Its gateway is an arch of black stone carved with sphinxes, manticores, dragons, and other strange beasts. The road is just wide enough for two carts to pass abreast. Buildings rise on either side of the roadway. One can buy almost anything in the shops on the Long Bridge. In the center of the bridge the hands of thieves and the heads of executed criminals are displayed.\n\nThe Long Bridge is one of the known world's most famous megastructures.  Lomas Longstrider included it in his list of the nine ''Wonders Made by Man''.  Other wonders in this list include [[The Wall|the Wall]] in Westeros, the [[Titan of Braavos]], and the great triple walls of [[Qarth]].\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 2]]===\nWhen [[Robb Stark]] refers to [[Talisa Maegyr]] as &quot;lady,&quot; she wonders how come he believes her to a member of the nobility.
