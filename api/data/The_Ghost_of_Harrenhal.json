It is the fifteenth episode of the series overall. It premiered on April 29, 2012. It was written by executive producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] and directed by [[David Petrarca]].\n\n", "In the books": ": ''See: [[Differences between books and TV series - Season 2#The Ghost of Harrenhal]] ''\n* The episode is adapted from the following chapters of ''A Clash of Kings'':\n** Chapter 20, Tyrion V.\n** Chapter 26, Arya VI.\n** Chapter 27, Daenerys II.\n** Chapter 28, Bran IV.\n** Chapter 33, Catelyn IV.\n** Chapter 34, Jon IV.\n** Chapter 35, Bran V.\n** Chapter 36, Tyrion VIII.\n** Chapter 37, Theon III.\n** Chapter 39, Catelyn V.\n** Chapter 42, Davos II.\n** Chapter 43, Jon IV.\n** Chapter 58, Davos III.\n\n", "Summary": "===In the Seven Kingdoms===\n[[File:RenlysDeathS2Ep5.png|thumb|King Renly is assassinated.]]\n[[File:Brienne kills.jpg|thumb|Brienne kills a Kingsguard]]\nKing [[Renly Baratheon]] is assassinated by the [[Shadow]] brought into the world by [[Melisandre]] just after agreeing to an alliance with King [[Robb Stark]]. His [[kingsguard]] [[Brienne]] is mistakenly blamed for the death and she flees the camp with [[Catelyn Stark]]. Brienne later swears fealty to Catelyn. Renly's army disintegrates, with the forces of [[House Tyrell]] fleeing to [[Highgarden]] and the rest of his bannermen joining his brother King [[Stannis Baratheon]]. Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] accompanies the Tyrell faction, sensing an opportunity to sway them to Joffrey's side. Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] challenges King Stannis on his use of Melisandre's magic and convinces him to leave Melisandre behind when they attack [[King's Landing]] to quash rumors of her influence on him. Stannis places Davos in command of his fleet.\n\n[[File:Wildfire.png|thumb|Tyrion discovers the [[Wildfire]].]]\n[[Hand of the King]] [[Tyrion Lannister]] brings news of Renly's death to his sister, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]]. She is pleased, but Tyrion predicts Stannis' imminent attack. He tries to discuss plans for their defense, but she insists on keeping them secret. From his spy, his cousin Ser [[Lancel Lannister]], Tyrion learns that Cersei has been having extensive meetings with the [[Alchemists' Guild]]. He visits Wisdom [[Hallyne]] of the guild and learns that they have stockpiled thousands of jars of [[Wildfire]], a dangerously flammable substance, to use as catapult ammunition. [[Bronn]] warns that this strategy could be disastrous, and result in panicking defenders accidentally burning down their own city. Tyrion orders Hallyne to answer to him instead of Cersei. Tyrion also passes a street protest that blames him for the ills of the city, as they believe Tyrion to be manipulating [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].\n\n[[Theon Greyjoy]] takes command of his new ship and finds his crew insubordinate. His first mate [[Dagmer Cleftjaw]] tells him that he needs to prove himself to the men and Theon plans to raid [[Torrhen's Square]] to draw the remaining forces of [[House Stark]] from [[Winterfell]]. His plan is successful and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] leads a force of 200 men to relieve his siege of Torrhen's Square. [[Bran Stark]] provides well judged counsel to his subjects but continues to be troubled by his dreams. He discusses dreaming of a [[three-eyed raven]] with the wildling woman [[Osha]] but she declines to interpret the dream. He also confides dreaming of the sea flooding Winterfell and drowning his people, including Ser Rodrik.\n\n[[Tywin Lannister]] hosts a protracted war council to determine a new strategy to deal with Robb. [[Arya Stark]] serves as his cupbearer. Though he does not know who she really is, Tywin realizes that she is of northern extraction and questions her about her origins and opinions regarding Robb. She manages to avoid revealing her true identity. She leaves to fetch water and encounters [[Jaqen H'ghar]], now a Lannister man-at-arms. Jaqen says that because she saved his life, and those of his two fellow prisoners, he owes her three deaths and offers to kill three people of her choosing. She targets [[the Tickler]], Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]'s torturer.\n\nThe Tickler is soon found dead in the courtyard, his neck twisted 180 degrees. Arya notices Jaqen on the walkway above and he holds a single finger to his face to signify his responsibility.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\n[[File:Ghost on a hill.jpg|thumb|The Night's Watch and Ghost on the Fist of the First Men.]]\n[[Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] leads his ranging to the ancient [[Fist of the First Men]] to rendezvous with the experienced scout [[Qhorin Halfhand]]. Qhorin arrives and warns Jeor that they must change their tactics to combat the wildling army under [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] \u00c2\u00a0[[Mance Rayder]]. He suggests sending a small party ahead to neutralize Mance's lookouts in the [[Skirling Pass]]. [[Jon Snow]] joins Qhorin's group.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\n[[File:Drogon_breathes_fire.jpg|thumb|Drogon, breathing fire for the first time.]]\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] has taught her [[dragons]] to breathe fire on command and they are now capable of searing and eating meat on their own. She is enjoying the hospitality of the wealthy noble [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\u00c2\u00a0in the city of [[Qarth]]. He hosts a gathering in her honor in the gardens of his home. She is perturbed by the tricks of the warlock [[Pyat Pree]], who invites her to visit the [[House of the Undying]].\n\nThe masked woman [[Quaithe]] delivers an enigmatic warning to Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] about Daenerys's need for protection from those who lust after her dragons. Xaro offers to fund Daenerys's invasion of [[Westeros]] in exchange for her hand in marriage. Later, she seeks Jorah's advice about the proposal and he cautions against accepting financial aid. He suggests that she will be able to win her throne should she reach Westeros with just a single ship. He reveals his depth of feeling for her but she does not reciprocate.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Charles Dance]] as Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]\n*[[Liam Cunningham]] as Ser [[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[John Bradley]] as [[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as Prince [[Bran Stark]]\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Stephen Dillane]] as King [[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Natalie Dormer]] as Queen [[Margaery Tyrell]]\n*[[James Cosmo]] as Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Jerome Flynn]] as [[Bronn]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Guest starring'''\n*[[Donald Sumpter]] as Maester [[Luwin]]\n*[[Roy Dotrice]] as Wisdom [[Hallyne]]\n*[[Ron Donachie]] as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Gwendoline Christie]] as [[Brienne of Tarth]]\n*[[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]]\n*[[Gethin Anthony]] as King [[Renly Baratheon]]\n*[[Ian Hanmore]] as [[Pyat Pree]]\n*[[Tom Wlaschiha]] as [[Jaqen H'ghar]]\n*[[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Gendry]]\n*[[Eugene Simon]] as Ser [[Lancel Lannister]]\n*[[Simon Armstrong]] as [[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n*[[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]]\n*[[Finn Jones]] as Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]\n*[[Ben Crompton]] as [[Eddison Tollett]]\n*[[Roxanne McKee]] as [[Doreah]]\n*[[Amrita Acharia]] as [[Irri]]\n*[[Steven Cole]] as [[Kovarro]]\n*[[Nonso Anozie]] as [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]\n*[[Gemma Whelan]] as Princess [[Yara Greyjoy]]\n*[[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n*[[Ben Hawkey]] as [[Hot Pie]]\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as [[Dagmer|Dagmer Cleftjaw]]\n*[[Forbes KB]] as [[Lorren|Black Lorren]]\n*[[Fintan McKeown]] as Ser [[Amory Lorch]]\n*[[Edward Tudor Pole]] as a [[Protestor]]\n*[[Laura Pradelska]] as [[Quaithe]]\n*[[Patrick Fitzsymons]] as [[Reginald Lannister]]\n*[[Art Parkinson]] as Prince [[Rickon Stark]]\n*[[Aimee Richardson]] as Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Anthony Morris]] as the [[Tickler]]\n*[[Donagh Deeney]] as a [[Winterfell shepherd]]\n*[[Kristina Krepela]] as a [[Qartheen woman]]\n*[[Slavko Juraga]] as a [[Thirteen member]]\n\n'''Uncredited'''\n*[[David Coakley]] as [[Drennan]]\n*Unknown as Ser [[Emmon Cuy]]\n*Unknown as Ser [[Robar Royce]]\n*Unknown as [[Eglantine]]\n*Unknown as [[Lannister bannerman 1 (The Ghost of Harrenhal)|Lannister bannerman 1]]\n*Unknown as [[Lannister bannerman 2 (The Ghost of Harrenhal)|Lannister bannerman 2]]\n*Unknown as [[Lannister bannerman 3 (The Ghost of Harrenhal)|Lannister bannerman 3]]\n*Unknown as [[Malakho]]\n*Unknown as [[Stonesnake]]\n*Unknown as [[Harker]]\n*Unknown as [[Borba]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n*Only 17 of the 25 starring cast members for the second season appear in this episode.\n*Starring cast members [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] ([[Jaime Lannister]]), [[Jack Gleeson]] ([[Joffrey Baratheon]]), [[Conleth Hill]] ([[Varys]]), [[Sibel Kekilli]] ([[Shae]]), [[Richard Madden]] ([[Robb Stark]]), [[Rory McCann]] ([[Sandor Clegane]]), [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark]]), and [[Carice van Houten]] ([[Melisandre]]), and are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n*[[John Bradley]] is credited ahead of [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]], [[Maisie Williams]] and [[Jerome Flynn]] when he was credited after them when they last appeared together in &quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]].&quot;\n*[[John Bradley]] is credited ahead of [[Stephen Dillane]] when he was credited after him when they last appeared together in &quot;[[The Night Lands]].&quot;\n\n", "Promotional video": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nFile:Game of Thrones Season 2 Recap 14|[[:File:Game of Thrones Season 2 Recap 14|Episode 14 recap]]\nFile:Game Of Thrones Season 2 Inside The Episode 15|[[:File:Game Of Thrones Season 2 Inside The Episode 15|Inside the Episode 15]]\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Notes": "*In the novel ''A Clash of Kings'' the series of murders at [[Harrenhal]] perpetrated by [[Jaqen H'ghar]] are attributed to a ghost. The episode features the murder of [[the Tickler]] by Jaqen at [[Arya Stark]]'s request.\n*This episode marks the death of King Renly Baratheon.\n**The night this episode aired, actor [[Finn Jones]] (who plays Renly's lover, Ser Loras Tyrell) posted to his Twitter account, ''&quot;When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/#!/FinnJones/status/196771591500201984 Finn Jones' Twitter account], April 29th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is actually a famous quote that Loras uses later in the book series.\n**Renly's death reduces the number of factions in the war to four: Joffrey Baratheon, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy, and Stannis Baratheon. Of course, due to geography if not ideology, Stannis isn't actively fighting Robb, because they're on opposite sides of the Lannisters' position in the middle of the continent.\n**This only includes the factions that are currently fighting each other in open warfare. House Tyrell, House Martell, and House Arryn are still active players in the ongoing political machinations of Westeros, i.e. Margaery Tyrell in this episode.\n*For the first time since she left [[Pentos]], Daenerys is brought up to speed on the current political situation in Westeros, including the death of [[Robert Baratheon]], and the fact that four rival kings now vie for the throne (word of Renly's death evidently not having reached across the Narrow Sea yet).\n*Daenerys says &quot;Dracarys&quot; to [[Drogon]], the young [[dragons|dragon]], to encourage him to breathe fire. Dracarys (pronounced &quot;drah-KAH-ris&quot;) is the [[High Valyrian]] word for dragonfire.\n*When Renly is meeting with Catelyn Stark, he says that the oath of fealty he wants Robb to swear will be the same one that Eddard Stark swore to Robert Baratheon &quot;eighteen years ago&quot;. In Season 1, the events of [[Robert's Rebellion]] were consistently said to have occurred seventeen years ago. This reflects [[Timeline#Differences from the books|the passage of time]] by Season 2.\n*Bronn refers to what Joffrey did to the &quot;birthday present&quot; that Tyrion sent him (which occurred in the [[Garden of Bones|preceding episode]]). In the culture of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], people actually use the term &quot;[[nameday]]&quot;, not &quot;birthday&quot;, because babies are named on the day they are born. &quot;Nameday&quot; has been consistently used on-screen throughout Season 1 and Season 2. This may have just been a dialogue error by the actor.\n*Wisdom [[Hallyne]], the head of the [[Alchemists' Guild]], is played by [[Roy Dotrice]], who narrated the audiobook versions of all five novels currently in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series (and thus in a sense is &quot;reprising&quot; his role as Hallyne). Roy Dotrice was originally supposed to play the role of Grand Maester Pycelle, but fell ill shortly before production on the TV series began and had to decline. His health later recovered, however, allowing him to join the cast as Hallyne.\n\n", "Recap": ":''Main: [[The Ghost of Harrenhal recap]]''\nA detailed recap of the episode scene by scene.\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nMargaery Promo.jpg|[[Margaery Tyrell]] in &quot;The Ghost of Harrenhal.&quot;\nBronnPromoS2.jpg|[[Bronn]] in &quot;The Ghost of Harrenhal.&quot;\nDaenerys 2x05.png|[[Daenerys Targaryen]] and Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] meet with [[Pyat Pree]] in [[Qarth]] in &quot;The Ghost of Harrenhal.&quot;\nTheon 205.jpg|[[Theon Greyjoy]] takes command of the Sea Bitch in &quot;The Ghost of Harrenhal.&quot;\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "Appearances": ":''Main:[[The Ghost of Harrenhal/Appearances]]''\n===First===\n* [[Emmon Cuy]]\n* [[Robar Royce]]\n* [[Reginald Lannister]]\n* Wisdom [[Hallyne]]\n* [[Lorren]]\n* [[Drennan]]\n* [[Dagmer]]\n* [[Malakho]]\n* [[Quaithe]]\n* [[Qhorin Halfhand]]\n* [[Harker]]\n* [[Stonesnake]]\n* [[Borba]]\n\n===Deaths===\n* King [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Emmon Cuy]]\n* [[Robar Royce]]\n* [[The Tickler]]\n\n"}, "title": "The Ghost of Harrenhal"}
