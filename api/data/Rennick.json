They debate on who is the greatest swordsman in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He argues against Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] who is big rather than skilled, and Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] who is just too pretty, though he does give credit to &quot;our man Jaime, if he ever gets out&quot;.\n\nThey both hear that the horses are spooked, but they aren't too concerned. Then he hears something and walks out into the darkness. The other guardsman follows hesitantly. When Rennick starts to draw his sword the man thinks they are being attacked, but Rennick merely passes gas and starts laughing at him.\n\n[[File:Rennick 2.jpg|thumb|Rennick looks up as guardsman screams.]]\n\nAs Rennick stops to urinate, the guardsman sees that the horses are getting more upset not less, but Rennick is not paying attention until the man screams his name. Rennick looks up just in time to see the [[Direwolves|direwolf]] [[Grey Wind]] leaping out of the darkness at him. In the subsequent attack by the Stark army the camp is taken completely by surprise and the Lannister army is annihilated.\n\nThe next morning the camera pans across the battlefield, showing Rennick's body lying on the ground. He has lost part of his face.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Rennick"}
