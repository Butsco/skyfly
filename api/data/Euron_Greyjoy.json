He has only appeared in the [[House Greyjoy]] family tree issued by HBO. Euron is an uncle of [[Theon Greyjoy]].\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Greyjoy family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Euron is a wildly unpredictable man, known for his delight in playing vicious mind games and waging psychological warfare on anyone and everyone around him. He is hated by all his brothers, particularly [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]]. He wears a patch over his left eye, which is nicknamed his &quot;Crow's Eye&quot;, though it is unclear what he hides beneath the patch.\n\nEuron has never been married. He has several bastard children, but does not have any regard for any of them, none were officially acknowledged, and none has been introduced in the narrative.\n\nSeveral years ago, Euron seduced - perhaps raped - and impregnated Victarion's third wife, which drove Victarion to beat her to death so he would not be put to shame as a cuckold. Only the taboo against kinslaying kept Victarion from killing Euron too. As punishment, Balon exiled Euron from the Iron Islands, so he is not present when [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] returns to Pyke. Victarion deeply hates Euron for that and wishes him dead.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nEuron Greyjoy is the younger brother of [[Balon Greyjoy]], head of [[House Greyjoy]], [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]] and self-fashioned [[King of the Iron Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/&lt;/ref&gt;\n===[[Season 1]]===\n[[Tyrion Lannister]] tells Theon about his memories of witnessing the [[Raid on Lannisport]] which Tyrion says was caused by Theon's uncles.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Euron Greyjoy"}
