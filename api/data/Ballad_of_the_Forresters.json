''\n:::''In floods of gold, I pray they drown, ''\n:::''For all the blood they spilled. ''\n\n:::''Mance, sound the horn of winters past. ''\n:::''Call starving giants forth. ''\n:::''Urge cannibals to break their fast, ''\n:::''On wardens of the North. ''\n\n:::''Eastern mages empty the veins, ''\n:::''Of beasts across the sea. ''\n:::''Paint Slaver's Bay in crimson rains, ''\n:::''To bring Ethan back to me. ''\n\n:::''Snow grabbed me from my mother's grasp, ''\n:::''To claim me as his prize. ''\n:::''Ethan freed me from Ramsay's clasp. ''\n:::''The rival lords locked eyes. ''\n:::''The rival lords locked eyes!
