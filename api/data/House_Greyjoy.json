It rules over the [[Iron Islands]], a harsh and bleak collection of islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the castle at [[Pyke (castle)|Pyke]]. The head of the house is the [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].\n\nHouse Greyjoy's sigil is traditionally a golden [[kraken]] on a black field. Their house motto is &quot;'''We Do Not Sow'''.&quot;\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Greyjoys have been a powerful family in the Islands for possibly thousands of years, long ruling the formidable castle of Pyke. When King [[Harren the Black]] was slain by King [[Aegon the Conqueror]] during the [[Targaryen]] invasion, the [[ironborn]] elected Lord [[Vickon Greyjoy]] of Pyke to succeed him as ruler of the isles, now oath-sworn to the [[Iron Throne]]. The Greyjoys have ruled ever since. The Greyjoys keep themselves distant from the other Great Houses, rarely taking part in events on the mainland (which they call the green lands) and, at various times, even returning to their ancient practices of raiding the nearby coastlines.\n\nAfter holding themselves aloof during [[Robert's Rebellion]], Lord Balon Greyjoy rebelled against the Iron Throne, declaring himself King of the Isles. Balon's belief was that Robert, who had only been on the throne for five years, did not command the total support of the nobles due to his status as a usurper and would not be able to rally the support needed to crush the rebellion. He was proven wrong and was defeated, with his fleet burned and two eldest sons slain during the war.\n\nAdditional Houses sworn to House Greyjoy, yet to appear in the series, include:\n\n* House Drumm of [[Old Wyk]].\n* House Orkwood of [[Orkmont]].\n* House Saltcliffe of [[Saltcliffe]].\n* House Volmark of Volmark\n\n", "Image gallery": "&lt;gallery&gt;\nGreyjoy icon.png|The icon of [[House Greyjoy]] from the HBO viewer's guide.\nGreyjoy sigil.jpg|House Greyjoy's sigil in black and white from the HBO viewer's guide.\nGreyjoy Shield.jpg|A shield emblazoned with the sigil of House Greyjoy from the HBO viewer's guide.\nGreyjoy-small.png|Small icon of House Greyjoy from the HBO viewers guide.\n203_GreyjoyMen.jpg|Greyjoy men holding the House Greyjoy banner in &quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;.\nGreyjoy Map-marker.jpg|A map-marker used to represent House Greyjoy forces.\nFall_of_Moat_Cailin.jpg|[[Roose Bolton]] receives the House Greyjoy banner from [[Ramsay Bolton]] after [[Fall of Moat Cailin|he takes Moat Cailin]].\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*{{AWOIAF}}\n\n", "History": "===Background===\nHouse Greyjoy is one of the [[Great Houses]] of [[Westeros]]. Their lands are the [[Iron Islands]] off the west coast of the continent. They rule from their castle [[Pyke (castle)|Pyke]] from the [[Pyke (island)|island of the same name]].
