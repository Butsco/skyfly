He initially appeared as a recurring character in the [[Season 1|first]] season and debuted in &quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]].&quot; He is played by starring cast member [[Jerome Flynn]]. He is a skilled and dangerous [[sellsword]] who comes to prominence when he champions for [[Tyrion Lannister]] in his trial by combat in the Eyrie. Bronn subsequently enters Tyrion's service as his bodyguard and enforcer.\n\nWhile Bronn begins as a common and obscure mercenary, over the course of the narrative his fortunes continue to gradually rise. Bronn is briefly appointed Commander of the [[City Watch]] in [[King's Landing]] when Tyrion is acting Hand in Season 2. He is then rewarded with a [[knighthood]] for the vital role he performed during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], taking on the formal name &quot;'''Ser Bronn of the Blackwater'''&quot;. His status in Westerosi society rises even further when he enters into an arranged marriage to [[Lollys Stokeworth]], as part of a political bribe by Queen Cersei. This betrothal elevates Bronn to the ranks of the upper nobility.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bronn is a sellsword chance-met at the [[Crossroads Inn]] by [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He is primarily motivated by money and the possibility of personal power, but has a rough loyalty to those who stand next to him in battle. Despite himself, he develops a grudging admiration and liking for Tyrion's craftiness and cunning, not to mention the gold it gets him. He has a black sense of humor, and a pragmatic, thoroughly amoral philosophy. Tyrion describes Bronn as &quot;an insolent black-hearted rogue&quot;.\n\nAfter hearing about [[Barra]]'s death, Tyrion asks Bronn &quot;If I told you to kill a babe... an infant girl, say, still at her mother's breast... would you do it? Without question?&quot;. Bronn answers &quot;Without question? No. I'd ask how much&quot;. Bronn's answer reflects his personality very accurately: there's nothing he wouldn't do for money, but there are still some things which would require a ''massive'' amount of money to make him do. Even Bronn, however, is utterly disgusted at Tywin when Tyrion explains what he did to [[Tysha]] when he was 13 years old (in the TV version, Tyrion was 16 when this happened). Bronn bluntly remarks that whether he was 13 or 30, he'd have killed the man who did that to him.\n\nNot much is known about Bronn's past before Tyrion encountered him at the [[Crossroads Inn]]. So far in the books, Bronn has made no mention that he has ever been north of the Wall, which he briefly mentioned in the TV series. When asked why he was there, he bluntly said that he was &quot;working&quot;. Bronn may have been hired as a guard for a smuggling ship, as illicit trade is actually fairly common between the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] and smugglers who circumvent the Wall by sailing around it. Wildlings don't possess the technological sophistication to forge their own iron weapons, and thus are eager to trade with smugglers from the Seven Kingdoms or the [[Free Cities]] who are willing to provide them. The wildlings don't have much in the way of wealth but can usually offer rare animal furs for trade, which they obtain from densely furred animals from north of the Wall which have adapted to the cold climate. In past centuries the Night's Watch tried to stop the fur-for-iron trade along the coasts, but in recent centuries as their numbers dwindled they abandoned any attempts to prevent passage around the Wall by sea. This smuggling is still dangerous and a good smuggling crew would probably hire a few extra sellswords for protection.\n\nBronn is not named Commander of the City Watch in the novels, but Jacelyn Bywater instead. Bronn was made the captain of Tyrion's guard, which is composed of sellswords chosen by Bronn himself.\n\nBronn is knighted after the Battle of the Blackwater for the vital role he played in destroying Stannis's fleet. Bronn was responsible for pulling a large chain across the entrance of the bay after Stannis's fleet entered, trapping them inside once the wildfire trap was sprung, leading to their destruction. The TV series condensed the battle so the chain subplot was removed, but it did still have Bronn play a vital role in the wildfire trap, by having him personally fire a flaming arrow which ignited the leaking fire ship filled with thousands of jars of wildfire. Following his knighting, Bronn is permitted to claim his own knightly sigil. He chooses a flaming green chain on a smoking grey field to commemorate the battle in which he earned his knighthood. As the chain was removed from the TV series, Bronn's sigil based on it was also not included. A nod to this occurs in Season 4's &quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot; when Podrick is describing the sigils of the Dornish envoys, and Bronn wistfully remarks &quot;I need a sigil.&quot;\n\nIn the books, it is Ser Ilyn Payne who trains Jaime in left-handed swordsmanship. This was apparently changed because actor [[Wilko Johnson]] (Ser Ilyn) developed pancreatic cancer and had to leave production on the TV series.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|Fair enough.

For this reason, he does not wear heavy armor or use shields, but instead relies on just his sword and knives. He is also a skilled archer&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Blackwater]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and is apparently literate.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 1]]===\nBronn is staying at the [[Crossroads Inn]] when [[Tyrion Lannister]] arrives. He volunteers to give up his room to Tyrion in return for gold. [[Catelyn Stark]] and [[Rodrik Cassel|Ser Rodrik Cassel]] take Tyrion prisoner before he can fulfil the promise.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Bronn accompanies Catelyn and Tyrion's party to the [[Vale of Arryn]] and listens to Tyrion promising a handsome reward to any man who helps him. Along the way they are attacked by [[hill tribes]]men, and Bronn acquits himself well in the battle, killing several opponents. Tyrion notes his prowess in combat.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Wolf and the Lion]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Bronn.jpg|thumb|200px|Bronn battles against the hill tribes. ]]\nIn [[the Eyrie]] Tyrion attempts to prove his innocence and demands a [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]]. He desperately asks for someone to fight for him and, to the surprise of all, Bronn steps forward to accept. Bronn kills [[Lysa Arryn|Lady Lysa Arryn]]'s champion, [[Vardis Egen|Ser Vardis Egen]], proving Tyrion's innocence according to Westerosi custom. Bronn defeats Vardis by relying on his speed against the armored but slow knight, and uses dirty tactics such as throwing obstacles in the way. Once Bronn has exhausted Vardis, he moves in for the kill, then throws his corpse out the Moon Door. Bronn then departs the Eyrie with Tyrion. Lady Lysa rages that Bronn does not fight honorably. Bronn nods in agreement, and wryly notes that Ser Vardis did.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring their crossing of the mountains, Bronn establishes some ground rules with Tyrion, stating that he is not Tyrion's friend or his sworn sword, and is only working for him for the money. Tyrion accepts the situation and promises to beat any attempt to buy Bronn's loyalty. Bronn and Tyrion camp in the Vale and are caught by [[Shagga]] and his [[Stone Crows]]. Bronn is prepared to fight but Tyrion wins over [[Shagga]] and the other [[hill tribes]] to his cause with promises of weapons and autonomy from the Eyrie.&lt;ref name=&quot;E8&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion takes his growing entourage to the Lannister army's camp in the Riverlands. Tyrion's father [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] invaded the Riverlands following Tyrion's capture because they are Catelyn's homeland. When Bronn is introduced to Tywin he quips that Tywin wouldn't have met his father, which Ser [[Kevan Lannister]] seems to find amusing but Tywin does not. Shagga demands that Tyrion fight alongside the hill tribes until his debt is paid and Tywin agrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;E8&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion_and_Bronn_1x09.png|thumb|left|Bronn plays a drinking game with Tyrion.]]\nBronn finds Tyrion a whore named [[Shae]] amongst the camp-followers. The three of them play drinking games on the eve of the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]. Bronn reveals that his parents beat him, that he killed for the first time before the age of twelve (a woman who attacked him with an axe), and that he has been beyond [[the Wall]]. Bronn awakens to find the opposing army almost upon them. Bronn rouses Tyrion and advises him on how to survive. This proves unnecessary when Tyrion is accidentally knocked unconscious by his own men during the rush to the fight. When Tyrion awakens after the battle, Bronn glibly tells him that they won.&lt;ref name=&quot;E9&quot; /&gt; Bronn later accompanies Tyrion to King's Landing when he is named acting Hand of the King.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Fire and Blood]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\nBronn remains the personal bodyguard of [[Tyrion Lannister]] when he takes up his position as acting [[Hand of the King]] to [[Joffrey Baratheon]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The North Remembers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrion rewards the sellswords' loyalty by making him commander of the [[City Watch]], having ousted his [[Janos Slynt|treacherous predecessor]]\u00c2\u00a0by sending him to the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Night Lands]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrion tests the loyalty of the [[small council]] by feeding them different versions of a planned marriage alliance involving his niece [[Myrcella Baratheon]]. [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] proves untrustworthy by revealing the specifics of his version to Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]]. Tyrion has Bronn and [[Timett]] arrest Pycelle and orders Bronn to cut off the old man's beard, which he does.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[What is Dead May Never Die]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion clashes with King Joffrey when his nephew orders the public beating of [[Sansa Stark]] following the defeat of [[House Lannister]] of the [[Battle of Oxcross]]. When Ser [[Meryn Trant]] of the [[Kingsguard]], accuses Tyrion of threatening the King, Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Ser Meryn should he speak again. After the ordeal, Bronn suggests that Joffrey\u00c2\u00a0is so spiteful because he is &quot;all backed up&quot; and would benefit from sexual release. Tyrion sends him two prostitutes as a gift but the plan backfires when\u00c2\u00a0Joffrey forces one to viciously beat the other with his stag head scepter and then show Tyrion what she has done.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrion learns about Cersei's plans to use [[wildfire]] against King [[Stannis Baratheon]] from his newest pawn, Ser [[Lancel Lannister]], and humiliates Lancel by ordering him to tell Bronn to kill him should anything happen to Tyrion. Bronn accompanies Tyrion to the [[Alchemists' Guild]] and criticizes Cersei's plan to use wildfire as catapult ammunition because of the risk of accidentally burning down the city, clashing with\u00c2\u00a0[[Wisdom]] [[Hallyne]] in the process. Bronn also informs Tyrion that the smallfolk believe that he is manipulating Joffrey and blame him for the ills of the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; King Joffrey triggers a citywide riot when protestors throw excrement at him by demanding that his guards kill them all. Bronn's men are hard pressed to restore order and several [[goldcloaks]]\u00c2\u00a0and the High Septon are killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;E16&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion_and_Bronn.png|thumb|Tyrion and Bronn before battle in &quot;[[Blackwater]]&quot;.]]\nBronn achieves a marked reduction in crime by culling the city's known thieves but clashes with Tyrion over the brutality of his methods. Tyrion enlists Bronn to help plan the defense of [[King's Landing]] against an impending attack by King [[Stannis Baratheon]]. Bronn is dismissive of Tyrion's reliance on books and warns that food is the most important commodity in a siege, speaking from personal experience, hence why he rounded up all the known thieves to prevent them stealing all the food.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Bronn_singing.png|thumb|left|Bronn sings the [[Rains of Castamere]]. ]]\nJust before the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Bronn is drinking and singing &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot; with the Lannister troops. Bronn tells the prostitute [[Armeca]] about the several times he has broken his nose. [[Sandor Clegane]]'s entrance silences the men. Sandor begins to challenge Bronn joking that he believes he is a &quot;hard man.&quot; Sandor tries to degrade Bronn and he retaliates with light humor. Just as it seems a fight may break out between Bronn and Sandor the bells ring out to announce the arrival of Stannis' fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot; /&gt;\n\n[[File:Bronn_2x09.png|thumb|Bronn, about to blow up half of Stannis' fleet.]]\nBronn meets Tyrion in the Throne Room to say farewell and then goes out of the city to the shores of the [[Blackwater Bay]]. When Tyrion signals him from the city walls he fires a flaming arrow into the [[wildfire]] they have leaked into the bay. His shot triggers a devastating explosion that destroys much of Stannis' fleet. Bronn returns to the city walls, arriving in time to save Sandor with a well shot arrow when Sandor freezes from the sight of a soldier on fire during the fighting. Bronn is left outside the walls when Sandor and his men retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;E19&quot; /&gt;\n\nAfter the battle, Bronn is dismissed from his post as commander of the City Watch, as part of Lord Tywin &quot;setting things back to order&quot; as he sees it.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 3]]===\n\nBronn is [[Knighthood|knighted]] by King Joffrey himself as a reward for the vital role he played in the Battle of the Blackwater. He now styles himself as &quot;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater&quot;, and while possessing no lands, wealth, or title, this drastically elevates his social standing - and in his mind, his pay. He tells Tyrion that he still thinks of him a friend, but he is still a sellsword, and as a knight Tyrion should pay him double what he used to.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valar&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter he finishes recuperating, Tyrion sends [[Podrick Payne]] to summon Bronn so he can continue to provide him with protection, fearing that whoever ordered Ser [[Mandon Moore]] to try to kill him will try to finish the job. Podrick interupts Bronn as he is celebrating his promotion to knighthood - by enjoying the services of the [[Prostitution|prostitute]] [[Mirelle]]. Annoyed, Bronn comes with Podrick to Tyrion's chambers. By chance, Queen Cersei had come to pay Tyrion a visit shortly before Bronn arrived, and brought two [[Kingsguard]] in tow. Bronn finds them guarding the door to Tyrion's chamber and flippantly mocks them by calling them incorrect names. When Ser [[Meryn Trant]] corrects him, Bronn\u00c2\u00a0reveals\u00c2\u00a0that he is himself now a knight. Trant is incredulous, so Bronn has Podrick confirm that &quot;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater&quot; was just knighted by the king himself. Trant dismissively says that Bronn is an upjumped cutthroat and nothing more. Bronn nonchalantly admits this is exactly what he is, but returns the insult by calling out Meryn for what he really is: a &quot;Grub in fancy armor&quot; with more experience at beating up little girls ([[Sansa Stark]]) than at fighting men. Bronn then insists that they let him enter the room, but Meryn warns that if he puts a hand on the door, he'll lose the hand. As they are about to fight Cersei emerges from Tyrion's chambers and takes Trant with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valar&quot; /&gt;\n\nBronn accompanies Tyrion and Podrick back to the brothel owned by [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish]] after Tyrion is promoted to [[Master of Coin]], to retrieve the financial record books which Littlefinger keeps there. While there, Tyrion rewards Podrick for saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater, by hiring the services of not one but three prostitutes for him, each of which boast some special skill. Bronn advises Podrick to pace himself.\n\nLater, Tyrion reviews the records, and explains to Bronn that not all is as Baelish would like the court to think. Bronn asks if he thinks Littlefinger has been embezzling money, but Tyrion says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it from anywhere he can. Littlefinger always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise [[Currency|money]] seemingly out of nowhere, but in reality [[Lord Snow|the Iron Throne is heavily in debt]], and Littlefinger procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from Lord Tywin and from foreign banks to whom the crown owes millions.\u00c2\u00a0Bronn points out that Tywin's own grandson Joffrey is now sitting on the throne, so he might be willing to forgive the debts that the crown owes House Lannister (seeing as, for all practical purposes, Joffrey is a puppet of House Lannister). Tyrion says that Bronn is naive if he thinks Tywin will simply forget a debt. Bronn says he isn't used to borrowing money and he isn't familiar with the rules, so Tyrion explains that basically, you lend someone money, and after an agreed upon amount of time, they pay it back with interest. Bronn asks what happens if you don't pay the loan back, but Tyrion says you have to. Bronn pointedly asks again what happens if you don't pay the money back, to which Tyrion explains that no one will give you loans again. Regardless, Tyrion isn't worried about the debts to his father, so much as he's worried about the debts to foreign banks, particularly the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]], the largest bank in the [[Free Cities]]. Tyrion warns Bronn that when debtors to the Iron Bank cannot repay their loans, the Iron Bank will first refuse to give out new loans, and ultimately support rebellions against them. Tyrion fears that if they can't repay the debt, the Iron Bank will eventually cut them off and start supporting Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon. \n[[File:We need Details.jpg|thumb|Tyrion is fascinated at Pod's ability to pleasure women.]]\nPodrick then returns, with the money Tyrion gave him to pay the prostitutes. Tyrion is concerned that he lost heart and fled, but Pod innocently says he did &quot;all sorts of things&quot; with the prostitutes - they simply refused his offer of payment. Impressed that not one, but three prostitutes enjoyed Pod so much they would provide their services for free, Tyrion and Bronn ask Pod to explain in detail what transpired, so they can take &quot;copious notes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Walk of Punishment]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTyrion is not at all amused when his father announces that he plans to force him to marry [[Sansa Stark]], in order to secure the Lannisters' control over [[the North]] when they eventually win the war. Bronn points out to Tyrion that he can easily wed Sansa and get a son and heir from her to placate his father, then just continue to have sex with Shae in private, thereby getting two women and a kingdom to rule for himself. However, Tyrion is concerned his mistress isn't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife, a mistress, and the entire North despising him. Bronn points out that Tyrion is wasting his time trying to be universally loved. Tyrion's fears prove accurate as Shae bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds Sansa.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBronn attends Tyrion's wedding to [[Sansa Stark]], as well as the subsequent feast. Unable or unwilling to spend the money to obtain better clothing, Bronn simply wears his regular badly-worn leather jerkin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\n\n[[File:Podrick_with_tyrion_and_bronn_waiting_for_doran_martell.png|thumb|Bronn with Tyrion and Podrick waiting for Doran Martell.]]\n\n\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;Bronn is present with Podrick and Tyrion to welcome all the embassy of nobles from [[Dorne]] who have come to King's Landing for the royal wedding. Bronn\u00c2\u00a0wonders why they sent Tyrion to welcome the prince of Dorne, and Tyrion explains that there is bad blood between the Lannisters and Martells. Bronn supposes this means that Tywin's reasoning is that if the Martells have come to spill Lannister blood, Tyrion is expendable. They greet the embassy but find that rather than the elderly Prince [[Doran Martell]], his hot-headed younger brother Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] has come in his stead, and that Oberyn already entered the city before dawn. Tyrion correctly guesses that Oberyn will be relaxing from his journey in a local brothel. Tyrion and Bronn arrive as Oberyn is arguing with two Lannister soldiers. Oberyn asks if Bronn is Tyrion's hired killer, and Bronn casually admits that it started that way, but he's a knight now. Oberyn asks how that came about, to which Bronn surmises that he supposes he must have killed the right people. Oberyn is amused at his honesty.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Screen-shot-2014-02-10-at-5-58-15-pm.png|thumb|left|Bronn trains with Jaime on the riverside of the Red Keep.]]\nBronn is asked by Tyrion to help train Jaime's left hand in combat. He meets the [[Lord Commander]] on the riverside of the [[Red Keep]] where Bronn insisted that they duel with sparring swords. Bronn uses his skills to outwit Jaime, but he becomes more competent later on. Simultaneous to the wedding celebrations, Bronn is asked by Tyrion as well to find a ship for Shae to travel to [[Pentos]]. At the wedding, Tyrion is worried Shae would be uncooperative, but Bronn assured him that everything had been sorted and Shae was safely away from the capital city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lion and the Rose]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing Joffrey's assasination and Tyrion\u00c2\u00a0being accused of being the culprit, Tyrion tells Pod to fetch Bronn but Pod says that Bronn is under investigation. During a sword training sparring session on the Red Keep's riverside, Bronn implores Jaime to visit his brother Tyrion in the dungeon. He tells him that Tyrion originally named Jaime as his champion in the Eyrie because he knew Jaime would ride day and night to fight for him, and asks Jaime if he is prepared to fight for him now.\n\nBefore Podrick\u00c2\u00a0leaves King's Landing with [[Brienne of Tarth]] to locate the missing Sansa Stark, Bronn has a gift for him from Tyrion. It is the axe that Tyrion used during the Battle of the Blackwater.\u00e2&euro;&lsaquo;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Oathkeeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Tyrion-bronn.jpg|thumb|Bronn visits Tyrion in his cell and openly doubts his ability to defeat the Mountain for him.]]\nBronn answers Tyrion's summons a few days after. Now garbed in fancier clothes, reveals [[Cersei]] has arranged for him to marry [[Lollys Stokeworth]], the second daughter of [[Stokeworth (Lord)|Lord Stokeworth]] and a [[lackwit]], essentially a bribe to sway him from helping Tyrion. The marriage will elevate Bronn's social status once again, becoming a minor nobleman. Bronn is satisfied with the arrangement because Lord Stokeworth's heir, [[Falyse Stokeworth|Falyse]] is barren, thus ensuring Lollys will eventually inherit [[Castle Stokeworth]], especially if Falyse suffers an &quot;accident&quot; beforehand. When Tyrion asks him why he bothered coming, Bronn reminds him of his promise to offer him double of whatever whoever wanted him to sell Tyrion out was offering. Despite Tyrion's offer of wealth and possibly a portion of the North, Bronn notes that it now appears unlikely that he will control the North through Sansa. Moreover, Bronn openly doubts his ability to defeat Cersei's champion, the huge and fearsome Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], as a single mistake could prove fatal. He points out that, despite their friendship, Tyrion never risked his life for him. Bronn explains: &quot;I like you... I just like myself more&quot;. Given the extreme risk, and the very valuable marriage prospect Cersei offered, her bribe was the obvious choice.
