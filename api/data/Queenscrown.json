It is located south of the [[Nightfort]]. Queenscrown was once a thriving town and holdfast, but is now abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/nightfort/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Nightfort entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/castle-black/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Castle Black entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the book)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels Queenscrown was renamed after Queen Alysanne Targaryen stayed there. The tower's merlons were repainted in gold in honor of her visit.\n\nQueenscrown consists of a single tall tower located on an island in the midst of a lake. There is a causeway located just under the water, but its location is difficult to see. This makes attacking the holdfast difficult. A small village and inn used to lie on the shores of the lake near the holdfast. The holdfast has been abandoned out of fear of [[wildling]] raids from the north. While the village has long-since fallen into disrepair, the tower remains relatively intact.\n\nIt is at Queenscrown (and not an abandoned mill as depicted on the show) that [[Bran Stark]] and his companions stay overnight as they waited for a storm to pass. While they waited, [[Old man|a man]] passing through arrived and stayed in the ruined village to wait out the storm too. [[Jon Snow]] arrived with the [[wildlings]] he was travelling with and they captured the man. Jon was ordered to kill the man, but balked and [[Ygritte]] killed the man anyway.\n\nCuriously, the map in HBO's Viewer's Guide does specify the location of Queenscrown, but no dialogue in &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]&quot; specified that this was the identity of the ruins where Bran's party took shelter. The Season 3 Blu-ray might provide more information in the future.\n\n"}, "title": "Queenscrown"}
