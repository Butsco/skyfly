Much like [[Volantis]] once tried to do with the [[Valyrian Freehold]], New Ghis seeks to rebuild the Ghiscari Empire under its leadership.\n\nNew Ghis has a powerful army and fleet, and uses elephants in battle. Its legions draw inspiration from the [[Unsullied]] warrior-eunuchs, but while the Unsullied are slaves the troops of New Ghis are free men who serve for three-year terms.\n\n"}, "title": "New Ghis"}
