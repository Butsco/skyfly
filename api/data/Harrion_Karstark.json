Harrion Karstark is a son of [[Rickard Karstark]], [[Lord of Karhold]] and head of [[House Karstark]]. He fought alongside his father for King [[Robb Stark]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. He is killed during the war.\n\n", "Family tree": "{{House Karstark family tree}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Harrion Karstark is the eldest son of Lord Rickard, and also joins his father and brothers in the War of the Five Kings.\n\nHarrion however, takes part in the [[Battle of the Green Fork]] and taken as a hostage, while\u00c2\u00a0it is his brother Eddard who is killed by Jaime Lannister during the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]]. Eddard serves alongside his brother Torrhen as part of Robb Stark's personal bodyguard. When Jaime realizes that his army is lost during the Battle of the Whispering Wood, he makes a final push to single-handedly carve his way through the Northern army in an attempt to kill Robb Stark in single combat. Jaime manages to reach Robb's personal bodyguard and kill several of them, including Eddard and Torrhen, before\u00c2\u00a0being knocked unconscious.\n\nHarrion is kept hostage at Harrenhal until the northern prisoners are released by [[Arya Stark]] and [[Jaqen H'ghar]] and Brave Companions turn on Ser [[Amory Lorch]] and deliver the castle of Lord [[Roose Bolton]]. Later Roose sends him, Robett Glover and Helman Tallhart to take [[Duskendale]]. They are defeated by the Lannisters. Harrion is taken captive, and his current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nFollowing his father's execution by [[Robb Stark]], Harrion becomes Lord of Karhold. It is unknown whether Harrion is aware of that, and if he is still alive.\n\nEddard Karstark was apparently switched with his brother Harrion Karstark (or at least, the names were switched) so TV viewers who haven't read the books would not be confused that more than one character named &quot;Eddard&quot; exists, even though [[George R.R. Martin]] made it a point in the books to re-use certain names for minor characters, i.e. to emphasize that &quot;Robert Baratheon&quot; isn't the only person named &quot;Robert&quot; in the entire continent of Westeros.\n\nRamsay Snow briefly masquerades as Harrion during one of the mind games that he plays on Theon. This isn't mentioned in the books, as virtually all of Theon's torture takes place off-page, and is only alluded to.\n\n", "Biography": "===[[Season 2]]===\nRickard tells [[Catelyn Stark]] that Harrion was killed fighting by Robb's side.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Prince of Winterfell]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (MAJOR spoilers from the books)\n* {{AWOIAF|Eddard Karstark}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n"}, "title": "Harrion Karstark"}
