They are led by [[Shagga]], and presumably by [[Dolf]] before him. They have weapons, but nothing compared to the Knights of the [[Vale]]. \n\n==[[Season 1]]==\nThe Stone Crows encounter [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Bronn]], who are returning from [[the Eyrie]] after Tyrion's [[First Trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial]] there. The tribes initially intend to kill them, but Tyrion talks them into an alliance with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] who, he says, are enemies of the Vale and will supply the hill tribes with money and weapons to take over the region themselves. They accompany Tyrion to his [[Tywin Lannister|father]]'s military camp, and he agrees to honor his son's promises to them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Pointy End]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The tribes later take part in the victorious [[Battle of the Green Fork]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Stone Crows"}
