He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it begins.\n\nDaeron\u00c2\u00a0was the first [[King of the Andals and the First Men|King]] of his name to sit on the [[Iron Throne]]\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0the eighth\u00c2\u00a0king of the\u00c2\u00a0[[House Targaryen|Targaryen]]\u00c2\u00a0dynasty to rule the\u00c2\u00a0[[Seven Kingdoms]]. He\u00c2\u00a0was formally styled '''Daeron of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm'''.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daeron I became king when he was only 14 years old, but quickly proved himself one of the finest warriors and generals in the history of Westeros. Later history and popular culture remembers him as the paragon &quot;young warrior king&quot;. Both [[Robb Stark]] and [[Jon Snow]] idolized him growing up. George R.R. Martin has described him as essentially the Alexander the Great of Westeros, in the sense that he was a young, preternaturally skilled genius at military tactics.\n\nWhile the Targaryens had conquered and unified six of the &quot;Seven Kingdoms&quot; during the initial [[War of Conquest]], the dry desert region of [[Dorne]] had remained stubbornly independent for the next 150 years. The Dornish accomplished this by resorting to guerrilla warfare, fleeing before the Targaryen [[dragons]] only to return and harass their supply lines as soon as the Targaryens withdrew their forces.\n\nSeeing Dorne as unfinished business for the Targaryen dynasty, and a blight on their claims to complete mastery of Westeros, Daeron I led his armies to invade it. The Young Dragon's tactics were brilliant, and his larger strategy was innovative: he feinted a typical invasion through the mountain passes of the [[Red Mountains]], luring all of the Dornish armies to the west. He then followed by sending the ''real'' invasion force to make an amphibious landing at the mouth of the [[Greenblood]] River itself, at the doorstep of [[Sunspear]]. The Dornish were caught completely off guard and with their army on the other side of the central deserts. Daeron thus conquered Dorne, succeeding where even [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon I]] had failed. This achievement was considered all the more astonishing because he ''did not'' have dragons, as the last of them had died out during the reign of his father.\n\nUnfortunately for the Young Dragon, ''occupying'' Dorne proved to be more difficult than conquering it. The Dornish settled into a long insurgency, ambushing the occupying force and then retreating. Dareon lost far more men during the occupation than he did during the conquest itself: ten thousand men in the conquest, another ''sixty'' thousand during the occupation. Ultimately the Tyrell lord he installed as governor of Dorne was assassinated with poisoned vipers in his bed, leading to a general insurrection. All that the Young Dragon had accomplished evaporated in a single fortnight, and Daeron I himself was killed in battle trying to fight the insurgency. The Young Dragon died young, at only 18 years of age, and after ruling for only four years. Dorne was to remain independent for another two generations, before later uniting with the Targaryen realm through peaceful marriage-alliance (a double-marriage pact in which Daeron I's own first cousins, Daenerys and Daeron II, married the Ruling Prince of Dorne and his younger sister).\n\nBoth Robb Stark and Jon Snow idolized the Young Dragon, as have many others, given that he is the type of young conqueror every youth hopes to be. Their uncle [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]], however, cautioned Jon that the real moral of Dareon I's life is that despite winning on the battlefield he lost the war itself. This presages Robb Stark's own death under similar circumstances, despite never having lost a battle. Dareon I was a great military leader, but not a great politician, nor particularly skilled at the day-to-day governance of the realm. Tyrion points out that his uncle and [[Hand of the King]], [[Viserys II Targaryen]], was the man really responsible for holding the realm together during his reign.\n\nDaeron I was unmarried and died childless, so he was succeeded by his younger brother Baelor.\n\n", "Quotes": "{{Quote|The ''Lives of Four Kings''.
