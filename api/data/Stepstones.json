According to myth, [[Westeros]] and [[Essos]] were once joined by a great land-bridge - known as the [[Arm of Dorne]] - across which the [[First Men]] invaded Westeros. The [[Children of the Forest]] destroyed the land-bridge with magic more than ten thousand years ago, leaving behind only the shattered islands as evidence of its passing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/lys/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Lys entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nToday the Stepstones mark the border between the [[Narrow Sea]] to the north and the [[Summer Sea]] to the south. There are eight large and numerous smaller islands in the chain, with the [[Free City]] of [[Tyrosh]] located on the northeastern-most island in the chain. Pirates, sellsails and [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] rule over and plague the Stepstones, making it difficult to establish any kind of outside rule there.\n\n", "See also": "* {{AWOIAF}} (spoilers from the books)\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, two of the islands in the Stepstones chain have been named so far: Bloodstone and Grey Gallows. Bloodstone is the largest, and the westernmost, located closest to Dorne. Grey Gallows is located south of Bloodstone. [[Tyrosh]] itself is located on an off-shore island at the eastern end of the Stepstones, but it is not considered part of them.\n\nAt least one of the Stepstones was conquered by Maelys the Monstrous, one of the Blackfyre Pretenders, in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], as a staging area for an invasion of Westeros. King Jaehaerys II sent an army to destroy his forces before they were ready, and Maelys Blackfyre was killed in battle by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]].\n\nAttempts by both the Seven Kingdoms and the Free Cities to conquer all of the Stepstones have failed. Apart from the fact that rival Free Cities are always competing over them, the local pirates and outlaws consistently resist any attempts made to impose outside rule. The Stepstones are predominantly lawless pirate-dens, but all sea shipping to the northern Free Cities (Myr, Pentos, Lorath, and particularly [[Braavos]]) has to pass through them. Shipping from nearby Lys, and even to an extent from Volantis, is also sometimes in danger of attacks from the pirates of the Steptones.\n\n"}, "title": "Stepstones"}
