Naerys had the classic Targaryen looks, a very fine and delicate beauty. She was very slender and small, with big purple eyes and fine, pale, porcelain skin, near translucent.\n\nAccording to semi-canon sources, she almost died in the cradle and was sickly for most of her life. She was a devout follower of the [[Faith of the Seven]], and once Daeron was born she asked Aegon to release her from her vows so she could join the Faith but he refused her. She was unhappy in her marriage and it was said only her son Daeron or her brother Aemon could make her smile. Her brother, Prince Aemon championed her against the slanders of Ser Morgil and was rumored to, not only have loved her, but also to be the true father of Daeron II.
