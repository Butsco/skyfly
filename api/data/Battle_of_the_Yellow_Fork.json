The location &quot;Yellow Fork&quot; is not mentioned in the books.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Oxcross]] opened up the northern Westerlands to [[Robb Stark]]'s army, his forces easily captured Ashemark.  For some reason, the TV series doesn't refer to a minor engagement at the &quot;Battle of Ashemark&quot;, instead referring to a &quot;Battle of the Yellow Fork&quot; taking place around the same point.  It seems that they changed the name to avoid confusion with [[Ashford]], which is a castle in the Reach.  It's possible that the &quot;Yellow Fork&quot; is meant to be the tributary of the Tumblestone, which is itself a tributary of the [[Trident]] River system, with its three main forks also named after colors:  Red, Blue, and Green.\n\n", "History": "===Prelude===\nHaving won a trio of victories in [[the Riverlands]] and a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Oxcross]] the army of [[House Stark]] under the command of King [[Robb Stark|Robb I]] pushes further into [[the Westerlands]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Old Gods and the New]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The victory at Oxcross has left the region lightly defended.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Garden of Bones]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Battle===\nKing [[Robb Stark]]'s forces assault the Lannister forces at the [[Yellow Fork]] and win another victory, taking many more prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;E17&quot;&gt;&quot;[[A Man Without Honor]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Aftermath===\nLord [[Rickard Karstark]] reports taking so many Lannister prisoners that the Stark cells are overflowing.
