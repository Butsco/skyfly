The Wardens command the armies of one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms in the name of [[Iron Throne]] for the defense of the entire [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]]. Thus any one Warden is expected to lawfully command a quarter of all armies in the realm during a time of crisis.\n\nBy custom, the title is functionally hereditary. However, a Warden does not necessarily have to also be one of the [[Lord Paramount|Lords Paramount]] (rulers of the constituent regions of the realm) though this is almost always the case. For example, if an elderly or infirm ruler came to be the head of House Lannister, the office of Warden might be delegated to another family member young and capable enough to lead armies in the field.\n\n", "Current Wardens of the Seven Kingdoms": "\n* '''Warden of the North:''' Currently held by [[Roose Bolton]], [[Lord of the Dreadfort]], for his part in the betrayal and murder of King [[Robb Stark]] during the [[Red Wedding]], until [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Sansa Stark]] sire a child and he comes of age. The title was previously held by the head of [[House Stark]], since the days of [[Torrhen Stark]], the King Who Knelt.\n\n* '''Warden of the West:''' Title held by the Lord Paramount of the [[Westerlands]] and Lord of [[Casterly Rock]], the head of [[House Lannister]], since [[Loren Lannister|Loren I Lannister]], the last [[King of the Rock]].
