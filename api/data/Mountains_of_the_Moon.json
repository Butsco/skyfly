They form the western edge of the Vale, separating it from the [[Riverlands]] to the west. They are a substantial mountain range with many splinter ranges that dominate most of the territories ruled by [[House Arryn]].\n\nThe western foothills and flanks of the mountains are home to [[Hill tribes]], warrior clans of varying size but unmitigated ferocity against the civilized inhabitants of the region.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[ A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Mountains of the Moon are tall and forbidding, among the tallest peaks in all of [[Westeros]]. The largest pass through the mountains is guarded by a fortress known as the Bloody Gate, while the [[Eyrie]], the seat of the Arryns, is built on the shoulder of the Giant's Lance, the tallest mountain in the region.\n\nDue to their superior knowledge of the terrain, attempts by either the river lords or the valemen to wipe out the Hill tribes have failed. However, they lack the knowledge and technology needed to successfully prosecute siege warfare against the Vale of Arryn, which they regard as their true birthright.\n\n"}, "title": "Mountains of the Moon"}
