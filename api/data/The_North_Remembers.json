[[Jon Snow]] is repulsed by [[Craster]], who has many wives, most of whom are also his own daughters, but who seemingly has no sons. Craster tells Jeor that he has not seen the missing [[Benjen Stark]] and reports that the other wildlings are assembling for the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] [[Mance Rayder]]. Jon challenges their host, who is low and crude, but is demanding and demeaning when he is talking to the noble Commander Mormont (who ignores his insulting behavior). When Craster refers to them as southerners, Jon argues with him. Jeor reprimands Jon, noting that Craster may be disgusting, but the Night's Watch needs him. His information and shelter in the harsh conditions north of the Wall have helped them many times before. Mormont asks Jon if someday he wants to lead and tells him that first he needs to &quot;learn how to follow.&quot;\n\n===In the Seven Kingdoms===\n[[File:SansaWatchesTourneySeason2.jpg|thumb|Sansa watches King Joffrey's tournament.]]\nKing [[Joffrey Baratheon]] holds a tournament to celebrate his [[nameday]] on the walls of the [[Red Keep]]. He is irritated by Ser [[Dontos Hollard]], who arrives both late and intoxicated for his bout. Joffrey orders his guards to pour an entire barrel of wine down Dontos' throat with a funnel. [[Sansa Stark]] intercedes telling Joffrey that ordering a death on one's name day is bad luck. Joffrey dismisses this as a mindless superstition, but [[Sandor Clegane]] seconds her. Sansa convinces Joffrey to instead make Dontos his court fool, for which Dontos is grateful.\u00c2\u00a0[[Tyrion Lannister]] arrives back in [[King's Landing]], to Joffrey's disdain, but to the delight of [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] and [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] who had worried that he was dead.\n\n[[File:CerseiSeason2NorthRemembers.jpg|thumb|Cersei is surprised to see Tyrion return.]]\nThe [[small council]] are in session to discuss [[the Conclave]]'s announcement that the long summer has ended. Cersei orders the city gates closed to refugees from the [[War of the Five Kings|war in the Riverlands]]. When Tyrion arrives with a letter from Lord Tywin, appointing him as acting [[Hand of the King]] in Tywin's stead, Cersei is furious. She is suspicious that Tyrion is taking power for himself, but he convinces her that he is there to act as an advisor. He criticizes his sister for failing to rein in Joffrey and overseeing numerous bad decisions, particularly the execution of [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]. Their actions have caused a war which, he adds, their side is currently losing. He is even more incredulous when he learns that\u00c2\u00a0[[Arya Stark]] escaped, pointing out how strong their position had been with three Stark [[hostage]]s.\u00c2\u00a0Tyrion hides his lover [[Shae]] in his chambers in the [[Tower of the Hand]] because he was forbidden by his father to bring her with him. She is initially thrilled at being brought to the capital.\n\nAt [[Winterfell]] Prince [[Bran Stark]] suffers through the petty complaints of his vassals, facing unrest at [[Robb Stark]] calling his banners and taking the young men south. [[Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] guides him in carrying out a lord's duties. Bran dreams that he is his [[Direwolves|direwolf]] [[Summer]] walking in the [[Godswood]], and when he looks in the pool, he sees Summer's reflection not his own which wakes him. He has [[Osha]] and [[Hodor]] take him to the pool and is reassured to find that his waking reflection is his own. They discuss the phenomenon of the [[Red Comet]], as many people think it means different things.\n\n[[File:Lord cast your light upon us.jpg|thumb|Stannis orders the burning of the Seven to honor the Lord of Light.]]\nOn the island of [[Dragonstone]], King [[Stannis Baratheon]] allows his advisor [[Melisandre]] to burn statues of the gods of the [[Faith of the Seven]] as an offering to her deity the [[Lord of Light]]. Maester [[Cressen]] is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that Melisandre is leading Stannis into a war that he cannot win. Melisandre proclaims Stannis a champion of the Lord of Light, as he draws a burning sword from one of the statues. Cressen asks [[Davos Seaworth]] to help him intervene but Davos says that it is not the right time.\n\n[[File:Painted Table Dragon motif 2x01.jpg|thumb|Stannis dictates a letter about Joffrey's parentage.]]\nStannis has received [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]'s letter, informing him that he was the true heir of King [[Robert Baratheon]], so he will send copies of a letter announcing his claim to the throne of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] to Lords throughout the realm. He details the incestuous relationship between [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister]] and challenges Joffrey's legitimacy. He rejects Davos's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother [[Renly Baratheon]], while Renly is claiming the throne for himself, despite Renly having widespread support, or even with Robb Stark, since while Robb does not seek the Iron Throne, he desires Northern independence, which Stannis sees as Robb &quot;stealing the Northern half of his kingdom&quot;. Cressen feigns an apology in an effort to trick Melisandre into sharing a cup of poisoned wine with him. Davos sees him drop the poison in the cup, and tries to stop him. He drinks first and hands the cup to her. Melisandre is aware of what Cressen is doing, but smiling she drinks anyway and is unaffected by the poison, and Cressen dies in vain.\n\n[[File:RobbtalkstoJaimeSeason2.jpg|thumb|Robb confronts Jaime with his [[Grey Wind|direwolf]].]]\n[[File:GreyWindJaimeFaceToFace.jpg|thumb|Grey Wind and Jaime.]]\nRobb receives the letter and interrogates the captive Jaime about his reasons for crippling Bran. Jaime reveals nothing and attacks Robb's decision to keep him in his mobile camp rather than with one of his bannermen as demonstrating a lack of trust. Robb asserts his faith in his men and his concern at the lengths [[House Lannister]] would go to in order to free Jaime. His direwolf [[Grey Wind]] is almost fully grown and menaces Jaime during the questioning. Robb sends his prisoner [[Alton Lannister]] to King's Landing with peace terms. His demands include the release of his sisters, the return of his father's remains along with the remains of all those who served him and the recognition of [[the North]] as a free and independent kingdom. [[Theon Greyjoy]] appeals to Robb to send him to [[Pyke]] to seek an alliance with his father [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] citing their need for a fleet in order to attack King's Landing. Catelyn counsels against putting trust in Balon because of his history of [[Greyjoy Rebellion|rebellion]]. She asks Robb to consider exchanging Jaime for his sisters. She then asks to return to her younger sons at Winterfell but Robb tasks her with seeking an alliance with Renly.\n\n[[File:Cersei_Little_Finger_Season2.jpg|thumb|Cersei asks a favor of Lord Baelish.]]\nCersei tasks [[Petyr Baelish]] with finding Arya. She needles Petyr about his unrequited love for Catelyn and he counters by referencing her relationship with Jaime, telling her that knowledge is power. She responds by threatening his life in a demonstration of her control over her guards. She warns him that power is power.\n\nJoffrey redecorates his throne room, hoping to restore the intimidating grandeur it held under the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]. He refuses his mother's suggestion that they ask [[Tywin Lannister]] for aid in the search for Arya because he does not feel it is necessary to find her and does not feel it is fitting for a king to ask for help. He blames Tywin for their losses in the war and the capture of Jaime. Having heard rumors about his parentage, he confronts his mother. She dismisses it as gossip spread by his enemies. He questions her about [[Robert Baratheon|his father]]'s [[Bastardy|bastard]] children and insults her by saying that Robert had grown tired of her. She slaps him, and he warns her never to hit him again under threat of death.\n\nLord [[Janos Slynt]] leads a city-wide [[Massacre in King's Landing|massacre]] of Robert's bastards. The infant [[Barra]] is killed in Petyr's brothel in front of [[Mhaegen|her mother]] and the [[Prostitution|prostitute]] [[Ros]]. [[Tobho Mott]] is interrogated and reveals that [[Gendry]] has left the city as a recruit of the Night's Watch. He says that Gendry can be identified by his bull's head helm. Gendry and Arya are travelling north on the [[Kingsroad]] with [[Yoren]]'s recruits.\n\n===Across the Narrow Sea===\n[[File:Dany-wasteSeason2.jpg|thumb|Daenerys leads her people through the Red Waste.]]\n[[Daenerys Targaryen]] leads her diminished khalasar east into the [[Red Waste]] to avoid her rivals. She is surrounded by powerful enemies who Ser Jorah tells her will kill her and take her dragons. The deadly emptiness of the Red Waste is her only option. She struggles to make her [[dragons]] eat what little meat she has, and her people face starvation. Her beloved white mare, her first gift from [[Khal]] [[Drogo]], dies prompting her to halt the march and send three of her [[bloodrider]]s in three different directions to scout for sustenance and refuge.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n*[[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n*[[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n*[[Emilia Clarke]] as Khaleesi [[Daenerys Targaryen]]\n*[[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\n*[[Iain Glen]] as Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]\n*[[Kit Harington]] as [[Jon Snow]]\n*[[Liam Cunningham]] as Ser [[Davos Seaworth]]\n*[[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as Prince [[Brandon Stark|Bran Stark]]\n*[[Richard Madden]] as King [[Robb Stark]]\n*[[Sophie Turner]] as Princess [[Sansa Stark]]\n*[[Maisie Williams]] as Princess [[Arya Stark]]\n*[[Alfie Allen]] as [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n*[[John Bradley]] as [[Samwell Tarly]]\n*[[Jack Gleeson]] as King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n*[[Rory McCann]] as [[Sandor Clegane]]\n*[[Stephen Dillane]] as King [[Stannis Baratheon]]\n*[[Carice van Houten]] as [[Melisandre]]\n*[[James Cosmo]] as Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]]\n*[[Jerome Flynn]] as [[Bronn]]\n*[[Conleth Hill]] as Lord [[Varys]]\n*[[Sibel Kekilli]] as [[Shae]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n'''Guest starring'''\n*[[Donald Sumpter]] as [[Maester]] [[Luwin]]\n*[[Ron Donachie]] as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n*[[Julian Glover]] as [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]]\n*[[Robert Pugh]] as [[Craster]]\n*[[Natalia Tena]] as [[Osha]]\n*[[Oliver Ford Davies]] as Maester [[Cressen]]\n*[[Mark Stanley]] as [[Grenn]]\n*[[Ben Crompton]] as [[Eddison Tollett]]\n*[[Joe Dempsie]] as [[Gendry]]\n*[[Ben Hawkey]] as [[Hot Pie]]\n*[[Eros Vlahos]] as [[Lommy|Lommy Greenhands]]\n*[[Roxanne McKee]] as [[Doreah]]\n*[[Amrita Acharia]] as [[Irri]]\n*[[Elyes Gabel]] as [[Rakharo]]\n*[[Steven Cole]] as [[Kovarro]]\n*[[Kristian Nairn]] as [[Hodor]]\n*[[Esme Bianco]] as [[Ros]]\n*[[Dominic Carter]] as Lord [[Janos Slynt]]\n*[[Kerr Logan]] as [[Matthos Seaworth]]\n*[[Tony Way]] as Ser [[Dontos Hollard]]\n*[[Hannah Murray]] as [[Gilly]]\n*[[Karl Davies]] as Ser [[Alton Lannister]]\n*[[Ian Beattie]] as Ser [[Meryn Trant]]\n*[[Pat Mooney]] as [[Northern Lord]]\n*[[Sahara Knite]] as [[Armeca]]\n*[[Maisie Dee]] as [[Daisy]]\n*[[Antonia Christophers]] as [[Mhaegen]]\n*[[Callum Wharry]] as Prince [[Tommen Baratheon]]\n*[[Aimee Richardson]] as Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n*[[Andrew Wilde]] as [[Tobho Mott]]\n*[[Natalie Lee]] as [[Chella]]\n*[[Gordon Fulton]] as Lord [[Portan]]\n*[[Marko Cindric]] as [[Tourney Herald]]\n*[[Josephine Gillan]] as a [[Marei]]\n*[[Dennis Stokes]] as a [[male prostitute]]\n\n'''Uncredited'''\n*[[Tobias Winter]] as [[Timett]]\n*[[Dennis McKeever]] as [[Night's Watch Officer 2]]\n*Unknown as [[Night's Watch Officer]] (relieved of his axe)\n*Unknown as [[Lothor Brune]]\n*Unknown as [[Aggo]]\n*[[Sarah MacKeever]] as [[Selyse Baratheon]]\n*Unknown as [[Stark Officer 1]]\n*Unknown as [[Stark Officer 2]]\n*Unknown as [[Barra]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast notes===\n* 23 of the 25 starring cast members for the second season appear in this episode.\n*Starring cast members [[Charles Dance]] ([[Tywin Lannister]]) and [[Natalie Dormer]] ([[Margaery Tyrell]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n* [[John Bradley]], [[James Cosmo]], [[Jerome Flynn]], [[Conleth Hill]] and [[Sibel Kekilli]] are all added to the main cast with their names appearing in the opening credits.

Later, the episode title was confirmed when it appeared on HBO's own schedule&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/#/schedule HBO]&lt;/ref&gt;.\n* The title refers to the rebellion of [[the North]] under their new [[King in the North|King]] [[Robb Stark]] in response to the execution of [[Eddard Stark]].\n*The phrase &quot;The North remembers&quot; is used prominently in the books, but only in later entries in the series. It is chiefly used in the context of a warning, in the same way as &quot;Winter is coming&quot; or &quot;A Lannister always pays his debts&quot;.\n*As the HBO behind the scenes featurettes point out, it took days if not weeks for Tyrion to travel to King's Landing from the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], so logically he wouldn't be wearing heavy armor that entire time. There was a considerable amount of discussion about what Tyrion should be wearing. Ultimately it was decided that Tyrion intentionally changed back into his armor just before he arrived, and this is a subtle hint about how he's choosing to present himself, both to Joffrey and to Cersei. Tyrion wants to rub it in their faces that he has been doing more to actively help the war effort than either of them, a war they started by Joffrey foolishly executing Ned Stark, while Joffrey and Cersei spent the whole time in King's Landing essentially just waiting for Lord Tywin to clean up the mess. They're even holding a tournament in honor of Joffrey's nameday while ''over half'' of the realm has risen in rebellion. This makes Tyrion's barb to Joffrey that &quot;We looked for you on the battlefield, and you were nowhere to be found&quot; all the more pointed.\n*[[Carice van Houten]] was previously asked to audition for a different role when season 1 was shot, but schedule conflicts prevented her from auditioning. She was asked to come back to audition during shooting of season 2, and was cast as [[Melisandre]].\n*In the books, Daenerys' [[Silver|silver mare]] does survive the journey through Red Waste\u00c2\u00a0on a diet of devilgrass. While edible, the grass was colored brown and grew in dry areas.\n*[[Josephine Gillan]] was only credited as new prostitute and only in Season 3 was her character's name was revealed as [[Marei]].\n\n", "Memorable quotes": "'''[[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]]''': &quot;The Raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace.
