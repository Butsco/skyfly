They are a center of trade, with ships passing through the straits from the city of Oldtown and ports on the Arbor to all parts of Westeros and [[Essos]], as well as the [[Summer Islands]] and [[Stepstones]]. In ancient times the straits were less safe, with the [[ironborn]] sometimes raiding as far south as their waters.\n\nTowns such as Vinetown, Starfish Harbor and Ryamsport sit alongside it.\n\n"}, "title": "Redwyne Straits"}
