Undo revision 179549 by [[Special:Contributions/90.58.11.102|90.58.11.102]] ([[User talk:90.58.11.102|talk]])[[File:Old Gods infobox.jpg|thumb|The &quot;face&quot; of a heart tree.]]\nA '''heart tree''' is the center of a [[Godswood]]. It is a [[Weirwood]] tree that has a face carved into the wood of the trunk. Heart trees are sacred in the religion of the [[Old Gods of the Forest]], and the closest thing to a &quot;shrine&quot; that the religion possesses.\n\nWeirwoods have red sap, which leaks out of the deep cuts in the trunk made for the eyes of the faces - giving the appearance that they are weeping tears\u00c2\u00a0of blood. The faces are thought to have been carved by the [[Children of the Forest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VG Dawn Age&quot;&gt;[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/beyond-the-houses/ HBO Viewer's Guide, Season 2 appendices, Westeros Through the Ages - Dawn Age entry]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n", "See also": "*[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Heart_tree Heart tree at A Wiki of Ice and Fire]\n\n"}, "title": "Heart tree"}
