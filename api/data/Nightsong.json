House Caron are known as the &quot;Lords of the Marches&quot;, suggesting they may have some superior authority over the other march lords (such as [[House Dondarrion]]). Houses Caron and Dondarrion allied together to fight the Vulture King, a bandit lord based in the [[Red Mountains]], some ninety years before the events of the books. Ser Arlen of Pennytree and his squire, the future Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], accompanied this campaign.\n\nIn the books, House Caron is effectively destroyed when its last surviving members are killed during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], resulting in the castle of Nightsong passing to House Foote.\n\n"}, "title": "Nightsong"}
