The [[Seven Kingdoms]] are at war, with the ''King in the North'', [[Robb Stark]], fighting to win independence for his people and those of the [[Riverlands]]. Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent [[ironborn]] to his cause, and sends his best friend [[Theon Greyjoy]] to treat with [[Balon Greyjoy|his father]], who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile, [[Joffrey Baratheon]] holds the [[Iron Throne]] with the backing of the powerful [[House Lannister]], but his uncle [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] has also claimed the throne with the support of [[House Tyrell]], whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne, [[Tyrion Lannister]] arrives in [[King's Landing]] to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], now the Queen Regent.\n\nHowever, there is another faction entering the picture. [[Stannis Baratheon]], Robert's younger brother and Renly's older, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of [[Robert's Rebellion|several]] [[Greyjoy Rebellion|wars]], Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is [[Melisandre]], an enigmatic priestess from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a greater destiny, and Ser [[Davos Seaworth]], an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis' court.\n\nFar to the east, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has hatched the only three [[dragons]] in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her ''[[khalasar]]'' gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a [[Red Waste|forbidding wasteland]] and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne.\n\nIn the distant north, the [[Night's Watch]] has mounted an expedition beyond [[the Wall]], searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of [[wildlings]] gathering in the mountains. For [[Jon Snow]] this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself.\n\n", "Media release": "[[Image:GoT Season 2 DVD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cover of the Season 2 Blu-ray box set.]]\n[[Image:Season 2 box set gatefold.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Season 2 box set.]]\nSeason 2 of ''Game of Thrones'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on 19 February 2013, and in the UK on 4 March 2013.
