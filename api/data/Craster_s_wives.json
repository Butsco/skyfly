Some (if not all) of Craster's wives are also his own daughters, which he &quot;marries&quot; once they have [[Flowering|flowered]]. Boys born from these couplings are sacrificed by Craster to the [[White Walkers]], while daughters are kept to serve him and marry him once they are of age - to produce more daughters to marry.  \n\nThis extreme [[Incest|incest]] is abhorrent to the [[Night's Watch]] as well as other wildling, and is not remotely tolerable in wildling culture.  Still, because he is one of the few homesteaders willing to give news and shelter to scouts of the Night's Watch, they grudgingly do not openly decry his behavior.   \n\n", "Known wives": "*[[Gilly]], who fled Craster's Keep after the [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|murder]] of Craster.

Some of his wives are also his daughters. Any sons he has with his wives are sacrificed after they are born, the daughters he keeps and marries once they are of age. \n\nWhen Gilly asks for help, Jeor Mormont points out to Jon that Craster's wives could have ganged up and killed him in his sleep years ago (at any point when he was deeply drunk):  Craster has psychologically abused and terrorized them for so long that they have become mentally incapable of fighting back against him.  It is the only world they know, not even allowed to mix with other wildlings outside of the Keep.  TV writers Benioff and Weiss compared it to the infamous 2009 case of Austrian Josef Fritzl, who kept his daughter captive in a hidden basement for 24 years and fathered seven children with her:  his daughter, and her children, had become so brutalized and dependent on him for so long in their isolation that it was difficult to mentally conceive of attacking him.  \n\nThe men of the [[Night's Watch]] are warned beforehand not to talk to Craster\u00e2&euro;&trade;s wives. After the [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|mutiny]], the betrayers take over Craster's Keep and rape some of the younger wives, but the narrative does not revisit Craster's Keep to show whatever became of them.  \n\nCraster's known wives are:\n*Gilly\n*Dyah\n*Ferny\n*Nella\n\nFerny was an older daughter-wife and may have been Gilly's mother, given that she referred to Gilly as &quot;my girl&quot;.\n\nGilly, who escapes with [[Samwell Tarly]] during the brawl, is the sole known survivor of Craster's wives. Since the [[Raid on Craster's Keep]] does not occur in the books, the fate of the remaining eighteen wives is unknown.\n\n"}, "title": "Craster's wives"}
