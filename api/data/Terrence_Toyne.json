He is long dead before the start of the series, and thus is not expected to appear. Terrence Toyne was a renowned [[knight]] of [[House Toyne]] and member of the [[Kingsguard]].\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Terrence Toyne was once found abed with [[Bethany Bracken]], one of King Aegon the Unworthy's mistresses. Even though they proclaimed love, Aegon had them executed. Toyne was dismembered piece by piece, while the mistress was forced to watch before meeting her own death. Ser Terrence's brothers attempted to avenge him by killing King Aegon, but were stopped by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight who died defending him instead. They paid for their treason with their lives and in turn this event was key in the downfall of House Toyne, which in a few generations devolved into a family of rogues and robber knights, whereas others went into exile across the [[Narrow Sea]]. [[Simon Toyne]], the leader of the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]] was the last of his line.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\nSer Terrence Toyne was fed to the dogs of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] for sleeping with [[Bethany Bracken|one]] of his mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Kingsguard (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===[[Season 4]]===\nTerrence Toyne is mentioned within the entry of [[Aemon Targaryen (Dragonknight)|Aemon the Dragonknight]] in the ''[[The Book of Brothers]]''.
