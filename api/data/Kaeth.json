He is deceased when the events of the series begin and is not expected to appear in the series. He was a [[Grand Maester]] and the author of the book ''[[Lives of Four Kings]]''.\n\n", "In the books": "\nIt isn't clear when exactly Kaeth lived, though given that the last of the kings discussed in his book was [[Daeron II Targaryen]], who died about ninety years before the [[War of the Five Kings]], he probably lived some time after Daeron II died. Nevertheless, he still lived quite a long time ago. Kaeth's ''Lives of Four Kings'' is considered a literary classic, and his hand-drawn illuminations to be a masterpiece; only four original copies of his book survived, until Joffrey senselessly destroyed one at his [[Purple Wedding|wedding feast]].\n\n"}, "title": "Kaeth"}
