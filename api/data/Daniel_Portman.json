Subsequently he was cast as Podrick starting in Season 2.  In the books, Podrick does appear in the first novel, being introduced in the Lannister army camp prior to the [[Battle of the Green Fork]] (corresponding to the episode &quot;[[Baelor]]&quot;).  Podrick's first on-screen appearance was pushed back to the beginning of Season 2, though his background may not have been changed - in that he might simply have been &quot;off-screen&quot; in the Lannister camp during Season 1.\n\n", "See also": "*{{Template:WP}}\n*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 4535552}}\n*{{Template:Twitter\n|# = Daniel_Portman}}\n* [http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/local-news-in-renfrewshire/paisley-news/2012/02/08/paisley-student-lands-lead-role-on-game-of-thrones-87085-30285319/#.TzK0uGGdJvs.twitter An interview with Daniel Portman.]\n\n"}, "title": "Daniel Portman"}
