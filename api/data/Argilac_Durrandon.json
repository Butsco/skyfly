After his death, Orys Baratheon took the sigil and words of House Durrandon as those of House Baratheon.\n\nArgilac got his nickname for arrogantly refusing Aegon's offer of marrying Orys (a bastard) to his daughter, cutting off the hands of Aegon's envoy and sending them back to him. He was also arrogant in engaging the Targaryens in open battle rather than withstanding a siege in the infamously impregnable castle of Storm's End. However, Argilac was motivated in this by having heard of the death of [[Harren Hoare]] in similar circumstances at [[Harrenhal]], who prepared for a siege in his immense castle only for the Targaryen dragons to fly right over the walls. If Argilac resisted a siege by Orys it would only be a matter of time until the Targaryens directed their dragons to the castle, so wishing to avoid this fate Argilac met Orys in pitched battle.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\n[[File:Orys_vs_Argilac.png|thumb|262px|Argilac is killed by [[Orys Baratheon]]]]When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] invaded [[Westeros]], he sent his commander and rumored half-brother, [[Orys Baratheon]], to take the ancestral stronghold of the [[Storm Kings]].
