Barristan notes that he had no family or friends, so he stood the [[Knighthood|knight]]'s vigil himself for Ser Hugh. Eddard is suspicious of Ser Hugh's death, wanting to know how he could afford a new set of armor so soon after being made a knight. Barristan reflects on the irony of them being on opposite sides of the war during [[Robert's Rebellion |Robert's Rebellion]]\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0now they are working together. He also tells Eddard that King Robert is planning to joust during the day's activities.          \n[[Image:Robert and Lancel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|King [[Robert Baratheon]] is dismayed to find he no longer fits his armor.]]\nEddard finds King Robert tormenting his squire, [[Lancel Lannister]], finally sending him off on a snipe hunt in amused disgust. Robert is adamant about fighting in the joust, but Eddard tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win. Robert is forced to admit that he's right, but they can at least watch the joust from the stands.          \n[[Image:Sandor, Gregor &amp; Loras 1x05.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sandor Clegane|Sandor]], Ser [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]] and Ser [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] at the tournament.]]\nThe first tilt of the day is between the fearsome Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], the Mountain, and the popular 'Knight of the Flowers', Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]. Loras gives a beautiful flower to [[Sansa Stark]], while [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] and Lord [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] make a wager on who will win (Renly bets on Loras). Loras is riding a mare that is in-heat, which confuses the Mountain's horse, causing him to throw his rider. Enraged at having lost, Gregor first decapitates his horse and then attacks Ser Loras. [[Sandor Clegane]] comes to Loras' defense, preventing his brother from killing him. They exchange several blows, until King Robert orders them to cease. Sandor immediately bows to the king, while Gregor storms off the field. Ser Loras declares Sandor the victor of the match, to the Hound's discomfort.\n\n[[Image:In the hills.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Tyrion Lannister]] and his escorts in the hills of [[The Vale of Arryn|the Vale]].]]\nTyrion Lannister has his blindfold removed and finds that their party - augmented by several knights and the sellsword [[Bronn]] from the [[Crossroads Inn]] - is on the road through the hills and mountains into [[the Vale of Arryn]]. Catelyn notes that she said they were riding for [[Winterfell]] often and loudly. Tyrion congratulates her on her cunning, while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return (a point that clearly piques Bronn's interest). He also says that Lady Lysa Arryn has gone mad since her husband's death and will try to kill him in the Eyrie. Tyrion also protests his innocence in the attempt on [[Bran]]'s life and points out he'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade. Before Catelyn can answer, the party comes under attack from one of the hill tribes. Despite taking several losses, the party is able to drive off the attackers. Despite having the opportunity to escape, Tyrion fights, killing his first man during the skirmish, and in doing so saves Catelyn's life. Afterwards, they resume their trek to the Eyrie.          \n[[Image:Bran and Luwin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] discuss geography.]]\nIn Winterfell, Bran is angry about his mother's absence. [[Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] tries to set his mind at rest about the matter, to no avail. However, when Bran gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery, Luwin suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow, of the kind used in mounted combat by the [[Dothraki]], a notion which pleases Bran. Elsewhere in the castle, [[Theon Greyjoy]] enjoys the attentions of his favorite [[Prostitution|whore]], [[Ros]], but becomes annoyed when she compares his prowess unfavorably to that of Tyrion Lannister.\n\nIn the [[Red Keep]], Lord [[Varys]] meets with Eddard. Varys tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be dead, unless Eddard can save him. Eddard wants to know why Varys is telling him this now. Varys tells him he had to be sure Eddard could be trusted. He calls Eddard an honorable and true man, maybe the only one in the city. He also confirms that [[Jon Arryn]] was assassinated with a poison called the [[Tears of Lys]], because he apparently &quot;started asking questions&quot;.          \n[[Image:Varys and Illyrio.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Varys]] secretly meets [[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]] under the [[Red Keep]].]]\n[[Arya Stark|Arya]] is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training. She chases one into the dungeons under the castle, where she finds the great [[Dragons|dragon]] skulls of the [[Targaryens]] in storage. She hears two men - Varys and Magister [[Illyrio Mopatis]] of [[Pentos]] - talking. Varys says that events have been set in motion and the [[House Lannister|lion]] and the [[House Stark|wolf]] will soon be at each other's throats. War is almost upon the [[Seven Kingdoms]], as they planned, but it has come too soon. [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] will not invade Westeros until his son is born and pronounced healthy, which is still many months away. Illyrio suggests assassinating Eddard to forestall the war, but Varys refuses.\n\nArya escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard, but she gets the words muddled up. They are interrupted by [[Yoren]], who has ridden non-stop from the Crossroads Inn to bring Eddard forewarning of Catelyn's capture and arrest of Tyrion Lannister. Eddard keeps the information to himself, while Arya asks [[Jory Cassel]] about the state of her father's household guard.\n\nA meeting of the [[small council]] is called, unusually with the King himself in attendance. King Robert tells Eddard that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the [[Iron Throne]]. He wants Daenerys, the unborn child and [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] dead as soon as possible. Eddard states that this act would be dishonorable, cowardly, and beneath their dignity. The other members of the council - Pycelle, Renly, Littlefinger and Varys - all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm. King Robert orders Eddard to enact the order. He refuses and resigns the Handship, to Robert's utter disbelief.\n\nEddard orders his household to begin packing. Littlefinger offers to take Eddard to the last place Jon Arryn went before he &quot;fell ill&quot;. Eddard agrees.          \n[[Image:Tyrion, Cat and Vardis at the Eyrie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tyrion and Catelyn in the Eyrie's High Hall.]]\nIn the High Hall of the Eyrie, Lady Lysa Arryn holds court on behalf of her young son, [[Robin Arryn|Robin]]. Lysa is furious that Cat has endangered them all by bringing Tyrion to the Vale. Tyrion points out that if he is harmed, there will be war with [[House Lannister]], but Lysa is unconcerned about his threats, as the Vale is strongly-defended and the Eyrie is impregnable. She orders him sent to the sky cells, three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside, forcing Tyrion to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep.          \n[[Image:Loras and Renly.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Ser Loras urges [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] to consider his place in the line of succession.]]\nSer Loras and Lord Renly, who are lovers, meet in a bedchamber. Renly complains as Robert is organizing a hunt in the Kingswood, which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal. Loras urges Renly to claim the crown himself, offering him the allegiance of his [[House Tyrell|rich and powerful family]]. Renly dismisses the notion, since he is fourth in line to the Iron Throne. Loras points out that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is a monster, that [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and Renly's other brother, Lord [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], ever becoming king, as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster. He also asserts that the people love Renly, and want to serve him because he is kind, and doesn't revel in violence, as his brothers do.\n\nQueen Cersei and Robert share a rare drink and discussion about the Targaryen threat. Surprisingly, Cersei takes Eddard's side, pointing out that the Dothraki cannot cross the [[Narrow Sea]] as they have no ships. Robert agrees, but if they land and the knights of Westeros take shelter behind their castle walls, the Dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the [[smallfolk]] accept Viserys as their king regardless. Cersei suggests that the unified armies of the Seven Kingdoms could defeat them, but Robert says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of Westeros. Their discussion moves to [[Lyanna Stark]], which surprises Robert, as in seventeen years Cersei has never asked about her. He tells her that Lyanna's death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill. He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold Lyanna's memory has on him, and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like. Cersei says that she felt something for Robert once, even after they lost [[Cersei's black-haired son|their first boy]], for quite a while. She asks Robert if there was ever any chance for their marriage, and he answers &quot;No&quot;.           \n[[Image:Eddard injured.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Eddard is stabbed through the leg by a Lannister guardsman.]]\nAt one of Littlefinger's brothels, Eddard Stark finds another one of Robert's bastards, this time a girl, and her mother, a whore named [[Mhaegen]]. Eddard is bemused as to why Jon Arryn tried to track down all of Robert's bastards. Leaving the establishment, Eddard, Jory and their guards are confronted by a large group of [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guardsmen led by Ser [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. Jaime has heard of Tyrion's capture and demands an explanation. Eddard says that he ordered Tyrion's arrest. Jaime threatens to kill Eddard, but Eddard points out that if he does, Tyrion will die as well. Jaime agrees this is true, so settles for killing Eddard's men instead. There is a brief engagement in which Eddard's two guards are killed by Lannister spearmen. In response, Ned and Jory fight and kill several of the Lannister soldiers. Jaime himself stabs Jory through the eye. Furious, Eddard crosses swords with Jaime. Jaime is shocked and then exhilarated when the older Ned is not as easily defeated as he expected. However, Jaime gradually starts to grow worried as Ned's high level of skill becomes apparent. Just as they are ready to clash again, a Lannister guardsman steps in and stabs Eddard through the leg with a spear, disabling him. Jaime is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman. He departs, telling Eddard he wants his brother back.\n\n", "Cast": "{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n'''Starring'''\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Lord [[Eddard Stark]]\n* [[Mark Addy]] as King [[Robert Baratheon]]\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord [[Petyr Baelish]]\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Sansa Stark]]\n* [[Maisie Williams]] as [[Arya Stark]]\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as [[Theon Greyjoy]]\n* [[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]] as [[Bran Stark]]\n* [[Jack Gleeson]] as Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]]\n* [[Rory McCann]] as [[Sandor Clegane]]\n* and [[Peter Dinklage]] as [[Tyrion Lannister]]\n\n{{Col-2}}\n\n'''Guest starring'''\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Maester [[Luwin]]\n* [[Conleth Hill]] as Lord [[Varys]]\n* [[Jamie Sives]] as [[Jory Cassel]]\n* [[Ron Donachie]] as Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]\n* [[Jerome Flynn]] as [[Bronn]]\n* [[Francis Magee]] as [[Yoren]]\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Lord Commander [[Barristan Selmy]]\n* [[Kate Dickie]] as Lady [[Lysa Arryn]]\n* [[Julian Glover]]as Grand Maester [[Pycelle]]\n* [[Gethin Anthony]] as Lord [[Renly Baratheon]]\n* [[Roger Allam]] as Magister [[Illyrio Mopatis]]\n* [[Emun Elliott]] as [[Marillion]]\n* [[Finn Jones]] as Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]\n* [[Conan Stevens]] as Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]\n* [[Ciaran Bermingham]] as [[Mord]]\n* [[Susan Brown]] as Septa [[Mordane]]\n* [[Esme Bianco]] as [[Ros]]\n* [[Jefferson Hall]] as Ser [[Hugh]] of the Vale\n* [[Lino Facioli]] as Lord [[Robin Arryn]]\n* [[Brendan McCormack]] as Ser [[Vardis Egen]]\n* [[Robert Sterne]] as the [[Royal Steward]]\n* [[Alan Paris]] as a [[Goldcloak 1 (The Wolf and the Lion)|Goldcloak]]\n* [[Kevin Keenan]] as [[Kurleket]]\n* [[Ryan McKenna]] as Ser [[Willis Wode]]\n* [[Eugene Simon]] as [[Lancel Lannister]]\n* [[Antonia Christophers]] as [[Mhaegen]]\n* [[Emily Diamond]] as a [[King's Landing Whore]]\n* [[Callum Wharry]] as Prince [[Tommen Baratheon]]\n* [[Aimee Richardson]] as Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]]\n\n'''Uncredited'''\n*Unknown actor as a [[Goldcloak 2 (The Wolf and the Lion)|Goldcloak]]\n*Unknown actor as [[Barra]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Cast Notes===\n* Starring cast members [[Emilia Clarke]] ([[Daenerys Targaryen]]), [[Iain Glen]] ([[Jorah Mormont]]), [[Kit Harington]] ([[Jon Snow]]), [[Harry Lloyd]] ([[Viserys Targaryen]]), [[Richard Madden]] ([[Robb Stark]]) and [[Jason Momoa]] ([[Khal Drogo]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.\n\n", "Notes": "* The title is drawn from a line of dialogue much later in the book, uttered by [[Tywin Lannister]].

She passed away on 29 December 2010 from swine flu.\n* The scene between Robert and Cersei was written at the last minute because the rough-cut of the episode was running short, and filmed in post-production reshoots, but turned out to be one of the writers' favorite scenes. Note that, as a simple interior shot in Robert's chambers, it didn't need to be filmed on-location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&amp;A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Renly states to Loras that he is fourth in line to the throne, behind Robert's sons Joffrey and Tommen, and Renly's older brother Stannis. This excludes Robert's daughter Myrcella, and Stannis's daughter [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]], who in a normal lordship would inherit ahead of their fathers' younger brothers such as Renly. The [[Lordship#Royal Primogeniture|Royal succession laws]] for the Iron Throne are, however, slightly different from those of normal lordships. After a civil war almost two hundred years ago between [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and her younger brother [[Aegon II Targaryen]], the royal succession laws were revised to put female heirs behind all possible male ones.\n*The second time in the show Cersei mentions the boy she and Robert had, following &quot;[[The Kingsroad]]&quot;.\n*Bran failed to remember the words of [[House Lannister]] &quot;Hear me roar!&quot;, perhaps because they are so rarely mentioned, in contrast to its unofficial motto &quot;A Lannister always pays his debts&quot;.\n\n", "Memorable quotes": "'''[[Robert Baratheon]]''': &quot;Do you want to know the horrible truth?
