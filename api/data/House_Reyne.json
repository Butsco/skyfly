They were not content with being the second wealthiest, however, and the last Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock, and gave his wife diamonds to wear which were bigger than any that [[Tywin Lannister]]'s\u00c2\u00a0wife [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]] ever wore.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEventually, House Reyne [[Reyne Rebellion|openly challenged]] their liege-lords, feeling that House Lannister's rule over the Westerlands had grown weak under Tywin's ineffectual father [[Tytos Lannister]]. In response, however, the capable young Tywin Lannister marched his forces against the upstart Lord Reyne. At the end of the [[Reyne Rebellion]], Tywin's army put Castamere castle to the torch, and had all surviving members of House Reyne put to the sword - man, woman, and child - as an example to any vassals who would dare challenge the Lannisters in the future. Tywin subsequently had the corpses of the executed Reynes hung from the gates of Casterly Rock on public display, where he left them to rot for the entire summer (it was a long summer, which lasted many years).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lannister featurette&quot;&gt;&quot;[[House Lannister (Complete Guide to Westeros)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Westerlands (Histories &amp; Lore)]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song &quot;[[The Rains of Castamere (song)|The Rains of Castamere]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lannister featurette&quot;/&gt;\n\n=== [[Season 3]] ===\n[[File:Castamere.png|thumb|left|House Reyne meet their end at the hands of [[Tywin Lannister]]]][[Cersei Lannister]] recounts the story of House Reyne's demise to [[Margaery Tyrell]] just prior to her brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s wedding to [[Sansa Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "House Reyne"}
