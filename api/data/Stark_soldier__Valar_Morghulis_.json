They do see the women hanging in the tree with the same sign, and Brienne pulls the boat over, climbs the tree, and begins to cut them down. However, when she gets high enough she sees the mast of the boat from Riverrun that is pursuing them, so she must leave the women unburied and they flee.\n\n", "Biography": "===Background===\n\nHe is fighting for [[House Stark]] in [[the Riverlands]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]] .\n\n===[[Season 2]]===\n\n[[Brienne of Tarth]] is escorting [[Jaime Lannister]] from [[Riverrun]] to King's Landing to exchange him for the daughters of Lady [[Catelyn Stark]]. She stops when she sees the bodies of three women hanging in a tree. One of them has a sign around her neck saying they lay with lions. Jaime mentions that they were probably tavern girls who had relations with [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers. Jaime confronts Brienne with the charge that this atrocity was committed by her side. She reminds him that she doesn't fight for the Starks, she has given fealty to Lady Catelyn.\n\nWhen they hear the three Northern soldiers coming, Ser Jaime says to free his hands, but Brienne ignores him. The Stark soldier is accompanying two other men, which includes [[Tom]]. Brienne tells the men that she is transporting a criminal to Riverrun for justice. Jaime adopts a lower class accent and says he stole a pig. When the three realize that Brienne is a woman they laugh hysterically at her. Brienne asked if the dead women were given quick deaths. The leader of the three bluntly says that two of them were.\n\n[[File:Brienne Jaime Stark Men 2x10.png|thumb|The soldier recognizes Jaime.]]\nAt this point the Stark Soldier recognizes Ser Jaime, having seen him at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]], and the leader challenges Brienne and Jaime to simultaneously say what Jaime's name is. She kills him and his companions, giving two of them quick deaths. She then cuts down and buries the hanging women.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n"}, "title": "Stark soldier (Valar Morghulis)"}
