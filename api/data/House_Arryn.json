It has ruled over the [[Vale of Arryn]] for millennia, originally as the [[King of the Mountain and the Vale|Kings of Mountain and Vale]] and more recently as Lords Paramount of the Vale and Wardens of the East under the [[Targaryen]] kings and [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert Baratheon]]. The nominal head of House Arryn is [[Robin Arryn]], the [[Lord of the Eyrie]], with his mother Lady [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] acting as Lady Regent until he reaches the age of majority.\n\nTheir lands are in the central-eastern region of the continent. Their seat is [[the Eyrie]], ancestral seat of the [[Mountain King]]s. House Arryn's sigil is a white crescent moon and falcon on a blue field. Their motto is '''&quot;As High As Honor&quot;'''.\n\nAt the start of the series, Lord [[Jon Arryn]] was killed in suspicious circumstances. His widow Lysa blamed [[House Lannister]] and sought refuge in the Eyrie. Despite her enmity towards the Lannisters, she has remained neutral in the [[War of the Five Kings]] and aims to use the forces of the Vale to defend Robin and the Eyrie if necessary.\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Arryn is the oldest and purest line of Andal nobility. According to tradition, the Andals landed on the Fingers, an area of peninsulas, hills and rivers on [[Westeros]]'s eastern coast, six thousand years ago and helped conquer the Vale. Ser Artys Arryn's duel with the Griffin King is said to have taken place on the shoulder of the Giant's Lance where the Arryns later built the Eyrie.\n\nDuring the Targaryen conquest, the Arryns planned to make a stand at the Bloody Gate, the only pass into the Vale, and gathered their armies there while the King of the Vale (also a young boy at this time) and his mother, the regent, took refuge in the Eyrie. Rather than risking a bloody battle, [[Visenya Targaryen]] simply flew her dragon [[Vhagar]] to the Vale and landed in the courtyard while the young king was at play. The king agreed to swear fealty to [[Aegon the Conqueror]] if Visenya allowed him to ride on Vhagar. She agreed, the bargain was upheld and the Arryns and their vassals became loyal subjects of the Targaryens.&lt;ref&gt;So Spake Martin, [http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Bubonicon_Report/ Bubonicon Report]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the summer they rule over the Vale from the Eyrie, but during the winter they descend to the Gates of the Moon, a castle at the foot of the mountain. The Gates of the Moon have not appeared in the television adaptation.\n\nJon Arryn and Lysa Tully's son is called &quot;Robert&quot; not &quot;Robin&quot; in the books. This change was made to prevent confusion with Robert Baratheon or Robb Stark. [[George R.R. Martin]] approved this change, noting that Robert Arryn's nickname in the books, &quot;Sweetrobin&quot;, remains intact.\n\nIn the books, the [[Heraldry]] of House Arryn is specifically sky blue, but in the TV series it is simply blue (azure), like House Tully's heraldry.\n\nThe members of the House Arryn in the books are:\n* Lord Jon Arryn, the former head of the family, now deceased.\n** His first wife, Lady Jeyne Arryn, who died in childbirth.
