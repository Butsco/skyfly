She is the former wife of Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], the former [[Lord of Bear Island]], and a member of [[House Hightower]] of [[Oldtown]]. She is the younger sister of [[Alerie Tyrell]], the wife of Lord [[Mace Tyrell]].\n\nWhile Jorah explained how his wife left him in &quot;[[Lord Snow]]&quot;, he did not state her name, though it is known from the books.  \n\n", "References": "{{reflist}}\n\n", "In the books": "In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lynesse is described as extremely beautiful with blonde hair and pale skin. Jorah Mormont says she looked a bit like Daenerys Targaryen. Lynesse married Jorah after he won a tournament to celebrate the victory of King Robert against the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], in which Jorah wore her favor. Lynesse was used to the riches and luxury of Oldtown and found Bear Island primitive and rude. Jorah's attempts to please his wife led to him spending all of his money. He disgraced himself through behavior unbefitting a lord, by arresting poachers and selling them to slavers. Slavery is illegal in the Seven Kingdoms and has been for millennia. When [[Eddard Stark]] came to arrest Jorah, he and Lynesse fled across the [[Narrow Sea]] to the [[Free City]] of [[Lys]], leaving his aunt [[Maege Mormont|Maege]] to become the ruling Lady of Bear Island. Jorah attempted to make his living as a sellsword, but was unable to provide an income acceptable to Lynesse. She left him and became a concubine to the merchant Lord [[Tregar Ormollen]].\n\n", "Biography": "===[[Season 1]]===\nWhen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] asks Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] the reason he had sold poachers into [[slavery]], he mentions Lynesse and her expensive tastes, which he always sought to please, leading to his ruin.
