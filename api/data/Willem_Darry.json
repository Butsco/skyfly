He was a grey bear of a man who was half-blind. He had a gruff, kind voice and big wrinkled hands, soft as old leather.\n\nAfter the Mad King's death in the Sack of King's Landing and Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella's]] death during labor, the garrison of Dragonstone considered selling Viserys and the infant Daenerys, to the new king. However, before they could come to a decision, Ser Willem and four loyal men smuggled Viserys and Daenerys from the island and fled to safety in [[Braavos]]. However, Ser Willem was old and some years later he became sick and died, leaving Viserys and Daenerys to fend for themselves.\n\n"}, "title": "Willem Darry"}
