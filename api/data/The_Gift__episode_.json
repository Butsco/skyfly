It is the forty-seventh episode of the series overall. It will premiere on May 31, 2015. It was directed by [[Miguel Sapochnik]].\n\n", "Notes": "*The title of this episode seems to refer to &quot;[[The Gift]]&quot;, the region of land immediately south of [[The Wall]] which was &quot;gifted&quot; to the [[Night's Watch]] when the Wall was constructed, for their sustenance and support. Both Bran Stark and Jon Snow passed through the Gift near the end of Season 3. [[Mole's Town]], the run-down village that Sam brought Gilly to in Season 4 but which was then attacked by the wildlings, is also in the Gift. As Bran noted, due to increased wildling attacks over the years and the diminished size of the Night's Watch, the Gift is mostly empty now. The title, of course, may turn out to refer to multiple things in the episode. For example, &quot;the gift of mercy&quot; is a euphemism for giving a quick death to someone who is suffering, to relieve them of their pain.\n\n"}, "title": "The Gift (episode)"}
