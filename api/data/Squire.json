Squires usually take the role of a personal servant, running errands for their masters and keeping their armor, shield, weaponry, and horse ready for battle or [[tournaments]].\n\nMen who haven't the money to buy armaments or the ambition to become a knight stay squires, and become men-at-arms.\n\nSquires frequently fight by their master's side in battle, though very young squires do not normally participate in combat.\n\nEven a knight can serve as a squire for another man, normally a lord. [[Daemon Sand]] squired for [[Oberyn Martell]] during the [[trial by combat]] in [[King's Landing]].\n\n"}, "title": "Squire"}
