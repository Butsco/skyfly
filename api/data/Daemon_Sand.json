He serves Prince Oberyn Martell as squire, and received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. There are also rumors that he is one of Oberyn's lovers, though this is seldom said to his face.\n\nSer Daemon is close friends with Arianne Martell, daughter and heir of Prince Doran, and took her maidenhead when they were both fourteen. When Prince Doran learned of this he didn't seek to punish Daemon, but refused to allow him to marry his daughter.\n\nHe is considered to be one of Dorne's finest swordsmen.\n\nHouse Allyrion is one of the &quot;salty Dornish&quot; families, those found along the coasts and Greenblood river system who have the most Rhoynar blood, and who generally have olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. Daemon's brief appearance in Season 4 of the TV series did not resemble this, but as it turns out, in the books themselves he is not described as having classic &quot;salty Dornish&quot; features. Instead, he is said to have sky blue eyes and light sandy brown hair. Daemon is a bastard son, so the simple explanation may be that he takes after his non-Allyrion parent in looks, and this parent was either a &quot;stony Dornishman&quot; from the western mountains, or possibly from somewhere outside of Dorne entirely.\n\n", "TOP": "Daemon Sand0254741gz3tpw1z626tkoyntq0tiu9zigsojy1765782015-03-13T11:19:20ZSer Patrek25358400{{Conjecture}}\n::''For other characters who share the same name, see &quot;[[Daemon]]&quot;.''\n{{Heraldry\n|leftimage=Martell mini shield.png\n|rightimage=Sand mini shield.png\n|leftlink=House Martell\n|rightlink=Bastardy\n}}\n{{Character\n| Title=Daemon Sand\n| Image=Daemon Sand.png\n| Season=[[Season 4|4]]\n| First=&quot;[[The Mountain and the Viper]]&quot;\n| Last=\n| Appearances=\n| Titles=[[Knighthood|Ser]]\n| Aka=The  [[Bastardy|Bastard]] of Godsgrace\n| Status=[[:Category:Status: Alive|Alive]]\n| Death=\n| DeathEp=\n| Place=[[Godsgrace]]\n| Allegiance=[[House Allyrion]]\n| Family=\n| Actor=\n|Culture = [[Dornishmen]]\n|Religion = }}\nSer '''Daemon Sand''' is a minor character in the [[Season 4|fourth season]].
