Since both of these cases were true when Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] crowned [[Lyanna Stark]] after winning a tourney at [[Harrenhal]], it was particularly scandalous.\n\nQueen [[Naerys Targaryen]] was crowned by her brother Prince [[Aemon Targaryen (Dragonknight)|Aemon the Dragonknight]], who was disguised as a mystery knight known as the &quot;Knight of Tears&quot;.\n\nPrincess [[Rhaella Targaryen]] was crowned by Ser Bonifer Hasty.\n\nSer [[Jorah Mormont]] crowned [[Lynesse Hightower]] after winning a tourney at [[Lannisport]],  requesting and receiving her hand in marriage from her father that very night.\n\n", "History": "===[[Season 4]]===\nIn Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]'s entry in ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'' it mentions that he named a commoner as the Queen of Love and Beauty after winning a [[tournament]] at [[Pennytree]] which King [[Aegon V Targaryen]] held in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Two Swords]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n \n"}, "title": "Queen of Love and Beauty"}
