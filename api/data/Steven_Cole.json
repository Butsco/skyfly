He is best known for playing the role of Leo Johnson on the popular British soap opera ''[[wikipedia:Brookside|Brookside]]'' from 1996 to 2001. He has also appeared in the British TV series ''[[wikipedia:Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]''.\n\nIt was revealed via Twitter on 7 September that Cole had been cast in a role on ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', debuting in the [[Season 2|second season]]. Initially, the role he was playing was not revealed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/#!/StevenCole_/status/110969103845556224 Steven Cole's Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September it was confirmed he was playing the role of [[Kovarro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Steven_Cole_is..._Kovarro/ Westeros.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the cast as a guest star in the [[Season 2|second season]].\n\nThe TV series seems to have basically switched the descriptions of the book characters Rakharo and Jhogo, and then renamed the character &quot;Kovarro&quot;. In the TV series, it is Rakharo who shows proficiency with a whip, and is relatively young, like Jhogo/Kovarro in the books. Meanwhile, Jhogo/Kovarro in the TV series is now (slightly) older than TV-Rakharo, and it is Kovarro who has a moustache. Thus the TV series character &quot;Kovarro&quot; corresponds to the book-version of Rakharo. Besides this name switch, the two characters are not particularly different from their characterization in the books.\n\n", "See also": "*{{Template:IMDb\n|# = 0170799}}\n*{{Template:Twitter\n|# = StevenCole_}}\n* [http://www.sourcemodels.co.uk/39762/models/Actors/Steven-Cole Steven Cole at Source Models.]\n\n"}, "title": "Steven Cole"}
